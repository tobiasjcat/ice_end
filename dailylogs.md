# Derwood's log

# The month of Eleasias in the year of 1059
## Blurnsday, Eleasias 1, (1059/8/1)
Fire, goblins and a lost donkey. All on our first day. Shortly after making acquaintances with a few of the Ice-enders we noticed a conflagration in the fields and found a farmer being hauled off by a wolf large enough to make Preston look like a house-cat. The wolf was accompanied by rampaging goblins perhaps for their arson capabilities. We dispatched the knappers without much trouble and even recovered Orson the lost donkey who had been happily munching rat-weed near town. This may be a rougher place than we expected.   
The farmer, Lydia Varnhold, is shaken but alright. My Hibernator strain roll-up helped calm her, I hope.  
Rikki missed the combat and continues to be the bulwark of confidence I have always known her to be. The melee has barely registered on her enthusiasm.  Preston continues to scowl since being unseated from his perch in our home in Lothal. I assure him there are plenty birds to watch in Ice-end.    
Drusilla had told us that she suspects the goblin camp is to the south so our first task here will be to seek out the camp and see if we can do something to stem the abduction attempts.  
After claiming our plots, construction on the new Derwood Estate has begun. In the meantime we are staying in the teifling Mordecai Nowhere's "Whitemoon Threads". He pedals a few adventuring trickets of little worth save for a wand of animal charming. A wand to charm animals is clearly an invention of city-dwellers.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 2, (1059/8/2)
This is a strange land. Summer in Lothal sees longer days but Summer in Ice-end has days long enough to properly slow-roast one of Rikki's giant pumpkins. The sun barely reaches above the treeline, even at its highest.  
Preston and I left Ice-end today after a few well chosen words with Rikki and a few poorly chosen buds. The group of us from the boat who rescued Ms. Varnhold, have agreed to journey to the goblin camp. None of them admit to strong adventuring skills before so I'll have my work set out for me. They had better _love_ mushroom stew. Janreth displayed impressive combat experience at Lydia's farm but I doubt the young Maslin has even stepped into a forest until today.   
Along with golbins and wolves Eturia at least provides ample berries, nuts, tubers and fungi. Our party will be well-fed as long as the picky of us can get used to camp food.   
We are all trying to keep an extra eye open for Steeltooth, the enormous bear Drusilla told us about. She stuck it with an arrow but as the saying goes, it takes more than one arrow to slay a bear.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 3, (1059/8/3)
With no signs of Steeltooth, Preston and I are making sure to check the skies for the other anomalies Drusilla warned us about. Seeing a griffon would be most exciting. Perhaps we will be able to fly messengers to Lothal. Preston and I can't make heads or tails of the bright flying object Drusilla had also described. Hopefully it was a good omen. Our skyward gazes have only found clouds and mountain goats so far.     
Since the ruckus at Lydia's farm, the party has been keeping one hand on our weapons at all times. Drusilla's healing potions are both a boon and a warning of the dangers ahead. Lets hope our weapons the potion caps remain sheathed.  
Janreth, and I have been trading watches while the others "sleep". From our lookouts lookout, we amuse ourselves watching the humans. Kristif snores contentedly while Maslin worms around trying find the most mattress-like section of ground.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 4, (1059/8/4)
I now regret agreeing to search for the goblin camp.  
We heard a strange horn in the distance and I traced it to a gorge ahead of the others. A deceased Corvaillian knight wailed for assistance in a macabre ruse by the goblins who animated his corpse. The three-day expired knight is an unexpected find in this land.
I am loathe to admit the goblins caught me off-guard while Preston was fetching the rest of our posse. I had asserted that I should lead with Preston to track the goblins but this rotting decoy was all it took to distract me and I was briefly knocked unconscious by three green runts. Luckily, the group arrived before too long and we were able to drive the goblins away, downing several.  
By the time the goblins turned tail, we failed to dodge a concerning number of spells, maces and arrows. Despite Kristif nearly succumbing to his wounds, not one of our crew even mentioned retreating. I am glad to be embedded with such a hearty group.  
The horn the goblins used to lure is now in our possession. This Corvaillian artifact serves nicely as an addition pipe. Air going the wrong way through a horn cuts some of the tension we have sustained.    
As we make camp, we acknowledged Drusilla's reliability as the tracks the goblins left revealed a southerly origin.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 5, (1059/8/5)
Morning arrives as evening had departed, the sun laboring across the horizon,  exhausted from rising to another noon for the umpteenth iteration. It will plod for a few extra hours to apologize for failing to properly exchange our shadows for warmth. Last night I mediated on Preston basking belly-up on the deck of The Other Shoe, absorbing the brilliant light of the white disk, proudly crossing directly over our heads in the gleaming cerulean sky. Now the panther just curls himself into a furry loaf for heat, glares at me and dreams of seagulls, the same star is now faded, bloody and occasionally peeking over clouds, themselves painted "Mediocre Fatigue" gray.   

Following the goblin tracks our party entered a pass between hills. Navigating between hills is more difficult than I expected. Exaggerated shadows of the cabin sized boulders are cast about the hills. As we made camp in a clutch of trees, I followed Preston's gaze to a startled lynx.   
During my watch, I spotted a flock of Perytons similar to the one I gave Rikki last Blurnsmass day. While the quills we harvested were quite useful for marking large signs, the twenty-foot wingspan and the flesh-devouring behavior of the beast made it rather untenable. How could an animal with the head and antlers of a deer eat so much meat? This flock in the process of decimating the mountain goat population of Lothal even. Note for next Blurnsmass: find a more manageable gift for Rikki.      


## Blurnsday, Eleasias 6, (1059/8/6)
Thankfully, the is no shortage of trees in ice-end. The others in the party are less thankful for the presence of trees for now but surely time and the pines will work their wonders because I am tired of having to convice this troop of the safety and abundance of the forest. Just this morning, as I was gathering rations ahead of the rest, I spotted a sunberry bush adjacent to a bloated-tuber concealed in the rat-weed.    
Other than sighting a few more Goblin droppings, the this Blurnsday ends without commotion.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 7, (1059/8/7)
Again I find myself unsettled by the hilly eclipses that happen throughout the day. Preston tells they disorient him too but I expect he is just protecting my feelings. He'll get some extra sweet-pod kibble with tonight's dinner for that and leading us to animal remains picked clean by the filthy-ones we've been tracking.  
They say "Fortune favors the brave" but it should be "Fortune favors the stealthy." By taking extra precautions we have finally dropped eyes on the Goblin camp without alerting the stinkers. The goblins have set up a "camp" on top of a prominent boulder. Marlow's companion imp demonstrated a notable abilty to vanish before our eyes and was sent to scout the camp of about two-hundred vile beasts. The imp, Nicolo, relayed to us that the gremlins have constructed semi-permanent housing and hog farms. The humans in the party lit up at the possibilty of eating something called "BAY-conn" in the future. I suspect they plan to eat the hogs if they could get their hands on them.   
Additionally, these goblins have set up regular patrols and have attracted a few and are even led by the largest of several bug-bears. A frontal assault will never succeed, even mustering the entire town of ice-end. The goblins, while frail, at least all have some combat training. I doubt many of the ice-end villagers could even name the difference between a halberd and a pike.   
I expected young Maslin to be the one proposing moghopper-brained schemes so I could barely conceal my surprise when Janreth proposed contacting the golbins. In all of my years, I have never observed goblins offering an olive-branch when they could offer the sharp end of a spear and these goblins have a lot of spears.  
Many of the dwellings are built with tree trunks and rudimentary thatching so I proposed using fire to do our work for us. How could the goblins even trace it back to us if they tried?   
Nicolo attempted to steal a campfire branch and ignite a nearby roof but the sparks were quickly noticed and extinguished. It would display an incredible feat of investigation if the goblins were able to blame us, or even suspect malfeasance. We will make camp in the trees and try something else tomorrow.    

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 8, (1059/8/8)
We made camp as quietly as we could but a patrol of three goblins still found their way toward our camp. Acting quickly, we laid an ambush. After some of the most impressive fighting I have seen from this group, we captured two goblins and detonated the third. All this before they could ring for help with an alarm bell we found on one. Preston and I agree, it's nice to have the upper hand for once.  
After the sun crawled up over the ocean, and after my many protests, we presented our new captives to the camp's gate.
While hidden, Preston and I witnessed something that astounded me: successful negotiations with goblins. This is no ordinary Blurnsday. A shaman from the camp was able to communicate with us using some sort of communication spell. They claimed to be willing to let us go as long as we returned their peers. We told them we wanted them to stop trying to abduct ice-enders. They told us they would never trust the "brassy-ones" who had driven them from their whaling grounds. Perhaps they are referring to Corvail and the knight of luring we had encountered on Blurnsday. I don't even want to consider the implications of enough brassy knights to unseat two hundred goblins _already_ in ice-end.  
Maslin left a coin with one of the now-repatriated goblins with the message that our people who bear the symbol of Lothal mean them no harm. Let's hope the goblin leaders recognize this gilded truce offer.
Let's also hope my own words will pair well with the crop of tubers I prepare for lunch. My sense of pride has recovered a little after admitting to Janreth that her initial idea of diplomacy was the right decision. Preston has been telling me I can learn from our posse of colonists since the boat and he has proven wiser than I again.  
Leaving the goblins to our backs we headed back to our little estates with a wry eye over our shoulders. I doubt any of us trusted to the goblins in totality. This proved prudent for incorrect reasons. The tail end of our day's journey was more exciting that we hoped when at least seven wolves attacked us. We detected their presence early and I was able to ensnare on in my trap but they tore up several of us. Kristif in particular took the crisp-fang side of the attack. Boasting the toughest armor and hand-to-hand skills of our party, he connected his weapons to the hide of the wolves many times but was ultimately downed while the rest of us slung spells and projectiles at the wolves from a distance. By the time the sun finally buried itself in the mountains, we all had recovered from the engagement just that much more eager to see our families and farms.   
Resourcefull as this group is, we skinned the wolves that didn't turn tail and collected four nice hides. Half of the wolves could barely fit in the stable for a horse and we suspect their hides will be especially valuable.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 9, (1059/8/9)
Keeping sharp eyes peeled for knappers and canines, we practically backpedaled towards ice-end. Concentrating on the trail we were creating, instead of the trail waiting for us, the distance home evaporated. Our vigilance resulted in our only battles today being our heels striking the dirt and the horizon rising to swallow the sun.  
Tonight we will rest our heads less than a quarter-day walk from ice-end.

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 10, (1059/8/10)
I've never been more joyous to see my nearly-completed home as today. The journey has been taxing and I crave a longer mediation to process all of the events of the last blurnsweek. Rikki has been doing a great job overseeing the construction teams to follow our plans and our hopes are high for the new Spinks Estate.   
Harbeck was rapt listening to our convoy's plights at Mordecai's. He gave us what little intelligence he had on the goblins and Corvail as well as rewarding us one hundred gold pieces each for our progress.  
I am learning to apprentice our little collection of adventurers every day. Rikki, Preston and I spent a pleasant night at Mordecai's watching Janreth, Dunbar and Whistia trade cards faster than a striking mamba. They call it "South Balthier". The surface of the table resembled a blur in the combination of rapid hands, fading candles, lukewarm lagers and a mashed dimple-cup. I will have to remember to mediate on the hospitality of warmth tonight.     
Maslin however has been had a change of heart after finally experiencing some level of adversity. Admittedly, my expectations for him we low when we first trekked away from his servant and soft furniture of the Whitemoon Threads but he has adapted well to living on the land. He may have been over confident when he dismissed all of the servants at dinner tonight. Seeing a silver opportunity, I leapt up from our table and offered the four of them two silvers a day to work for at the Spinks Estate. I am told they were making a third of that under Maslin and they don't have a lot of options for employment out here. After some debate and hesitation they agreed and I bought the next round for them. I have high hopes for what they can accomplish for us. I hope Maslin will be alright without his usual support staff.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 11, (1059/8/11)
Having acquired four new interns overnight, the Spinks Estate is growing rapidly. The former servants are not used to farm labor but they are hard workers and there are many simple jobs for them on the farmstead. One job they cannot accomplish is producing fowl eggs. For that I placed an order with Harbeck for five chickens. A few of the other new colonists-turned-adventurers also made sizeable orders with Harbeck for livestock.  
Confident that Rikki has all the help she needs laying fertilizer for now, I joined up with the rest of the do-crew and we visited the Herbalist Elena Thorpe. While a thorny character herself, she is married to the delightful gnome Thaddeus Jim-jar Thorpe. I am very glad I have someone to practice my gnomish with. Yip-yip indeed Thaddeus.    
As well as discovering a new friend, Elena's property revealed a well-kept garden. In it, Thaddeus was able to identify some strange plants for us including Devil's Club, Bright-weed and frost-flowers. Thaddeus also placed a bounty on some tundra-cress on the north side of the river from town.  
Maslin approached me asking for an opportunity to study under me to learn which plants are edible. I don't blame him for not instinctively knowing that a barbed and thorny plant like devil's club actually tastes a lot like bread if prepared correctly. However this puts me in the awkward position of somehow ordering His-Highness around. He agreed to an unpaid internship and even offered coin in exchange for knowledge but I turned him down. His relatives my have a problem with such a one-sided deal. Perhaps I can convince him later to share some land with the Spinks Estate in exchange for my training and a share of the crops grown on his land.      
Still, I feel uncomfortable asking a noble to behave like a disiplined student so I promoted Maslins former servant, Allen, to the title of foreman. Hopefully he will know the right way to encourage Maslin to work and learn.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 14, (1059/8/14)
The Spinks family somehow missed the invitation from Marlow and Calvin for dinner. Preston acted out for a while until we learned the guest list consisted  of the religious in our community. I'm sure we dodged the arrow from the archers Tenorio, Janreth and Kristif. To my dismay, Preston was brought to the brink of tears by Nicolo's lovely poem, recited for us by the other, more impish Nicolo later that night. We should engrave a plate of "The Lonely Butterfly" so that we can print copies. Tenorio was so moved he drank several bottles of wine in anticipation, during the performance, and after hearing the poem.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 15, (1059/8/13)
Well the sun is nearly at its highest point and Maslin is nowhere to be found. I asked his former hands about his whereabouts and they suggested the young prince would be found in his bed. Allen and I a reluctant to fetch him as the whole situation still feels marginally exploitative. We will toil on without him.  
Our predictions of Maslin's absence were revealed to be untrue. He had been discussing potential contracts with Harbeck. Harbeck divulged this to us when he and Maslin meandered onto the farm. The Director-General informed us that he tasked the Briggs brothers to return some large pine logs for the construction of ships for the colony. Noting Maslin's enthusiasm, he intuited that I would enjoy tagging along. It will be refreshing to be sharing quarters with massive pines again.    
Less appealingly, he also posted a job to expose Magicite in the nearby mountains.    


Mica informs us that our Harbeck's bounty is Etruruia Cedar. It is uniquely good for carving into canoe shapes. The trunks are known to have ribbon-y bark. Mica borrowed the horse "Bortrum" and Bortrum's cart for hauling back the lumber.  

Maslin, in a fit to prove himself, volunteered to navigate for our group. Oh well. More time for me to scrounge up some grub and enjoy relaxing my mind for a while. We're following the river so what's the worst that could happen?  
Drizzle greeted our faces as we marched uphill on the south side of the St. Reese. To our South is a vast plain littered with a few scraps of vegetation. On the north bank is a thick deciduous forest.
The rain continued to make salutations and rudely invited itself into our camp. Maslin took shelter in his bed-roll and is sleeping like a rock after hiking and navigating all day.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 16, (1059/8/16)

By the time the sun breached the horizon, and with its welcome far expired, the rain departed unceremoniously. Clouds linger promising rains regress.    
We should determine if Mordecai has tents for sale.  
I took over navigation duty since Maslin was still working on wringing out his outfit. Our journey took us through some cliffs adjacent to house height waterfalls. Having scaled the cliff, Maslin played the role of aspiring horticulturist by testing a newfound berry on his own digestive system. Plucked from knee-high bushes, with no hesitation, the off-white berry caused Maslin to heave and retch like he was being paid to. We all shared a chuckle watching the young prince vomit his breakfast: air. The berries needed a name so that we could more easily relay this story to others so we came up with "Little Angry"s.  

We then arrived at the cedar forest to the dismaying discovery that only Mica had the foresight to bring an ax. At least he and Kristif could work in shifts. Preston and I retreated to exploring the forest from the whining and Janreth's booming magical attempts to cheat the ax of elbow grease. Other than a few tasty tubers, Preston and I found only moss and trees. Many times both. This forest is a blend of Pine, Cedar, Spruce and Birch. A of the leaves have begun to signal Autumn's Approach. I hope we planted enough to get through the winter. Near the end of our patrol, Preston's nose led us to the desicated remains of a hare. The bones carry deep scratches indicating the immense size of the Canid who feasted on this rabbit. The memories of our encounter with the giant wolves last blurnsday the eighth led me to setting my animal trap by the camp.     
The other stalker we acquired is the forest on the north bank. It has quietly hunted us even here, always a little out of reach, but never out of sight. Janreth and I will make sure to keep the feral forest keeps arrow-shot away from us on watch tonight. Nicolo was brave enough to tempt the hunter with a closer look. He reported his inability to feed on the imp staple, wasps, on the north bank due to their engorged size. Truly disturbing.   
By time we made camp, Kristif and Mica had felled eight cedars. Five have been roped the Botrum's cart. The other three were sent down the river in the hopes that Ice-end might catch a few logs and save Bortrum from another long-haul. The conversation around the campfire tonight focused on a hearty debate on what to call individuals who protest against "the One True God" as Marlowe would have it. I suppose Janreth and I are now the Protestants of the group.     
As the argument settled and we had cleaned our mess kits, a figure approached. Preston and I skirted out of camp hopefully before we were noticed and took ambushing positions within earshot of camp. The hooded figure revealed itself to be a collection of worms pressed into human shape. As if from a thousand minuscule mouths, the voice of the crawling contraption identified itself as "Annelida", a two year resident of this forest who came seeking the warmth of our campfire. It told the others that it had no companions and needed our help infiltrating a library some ways off. Mica must be quite adverse to helping others because I could see him "disagreeing" with his dinner behind the cart at the sight of Annelida's visage. Annelida conveyed the location of the library and its camp with a crude squirming map while also offering gold in exchange for our assistance. Some kind of magic prevents Annelida from entering the library.   
Back at camp, we were all dumbfounded by the tale of ancient ruins in the forest. How could this continent have so many secrets? What other mysteries will reveal themselves before next Blurnsmass?
Our next decisions were far from mysterious however. We all agreed with Mica's proclamation that we depart for Ice-End come sunrise and return to the forest to search for the library after depositing Mica in town. Crossing over the same ground at least three more times should allow Marlowe to hone her cartography skills.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 17, (1059/8/17)
Our uneventful night and morning was broken by Mica's keen eye spotting a brown lump floating down the river. The most curious of us, Kristif tied a rope around himself and waded into the river to see the lump up close.  
A lot of effort was spent to reveal it as a rotting mammoth corpse. Never have any of us seen mammoths before. Nor have we seen anything here that could gore a mammoth and leave it in this state. More mysteries. Preston the optimist is the only excited on. He pointed out the mammoth would be an excellent beast of burden, if tamable. Maybe that wand of animal charming at Whitemoon Threads could be useful in the end.   
As agreed, we did not make camp tonight but will continue hiking through the night.   

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 18, (1059/8/18)
Our feet met familiar floors in ice-end early in the day. Harbeck greeted us with a bittersweet conversation. Not only had he let the three cedars in the river float into the bay, he also had even less knowledge about the worm-person, the mammoth, the over-sized wasps, or the ruins. He was able to sweeten our return with heavier coin purses though. Each of us left Harbeck's with an extra seventy-five gold.
We paid Whistia a visit and displayed the Little-Angries Maslin and Marlowe had collected. Barely glancing at the berries she returned to her solitary gardening after belting out "Snowberries. Very Poisonous. Don't trust berries that birds eat." A polite but terse interrogation later led to her sharing some potion recipes that used the Snowberries, so we are keeping them.
We stopped by Drusilla's place to ask about the week's conundrums but she was out of town. Scouting the forests and seeking Steeltooth no doubt.  
I need a good mediation and a nice bath after our hasty hike homeward. Tomorrow, as long as Maslin is on time, we should set out early in the morning prepared for an adventure to the library

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 19, (1059/8/19)
Well-fed, well-led and well-bedded our group were able to make it to the cedar forest barely before the sun made contact with the distant mountaintops.

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 20, (1059/8/20)
Possibly offended by our previous hospitality, the clouds and their unpleasant companion did not approach our door to knock and poke a greedy nose in. We trekked quickly to the ruins with a clear view of the sky between the trees.

Clear and sunny day. Found the library in a cluster of ruined structures three hours from our camp on the edge of the forest. Three stories tall, with two single story wings. The library is the only remaining building but it is also overgrown. The library is surrounded by a uneven bubble of abjuration magic. Nicolo and Kristif are excluded. Kristif finds his own way in through the top of the bubble from a nearby tree. Nicolo follows.  Burnt, rotted and water logged books and shelves.   
Turned the books over, found thirteen items of text. Text written in elvish script but not recognized by the party.  
Big statue in the plaza of a armored humanoid with a stern face on top of a big iron disk. Disk has same unknown script and indentation. Two overgrown trees are in this room.  
Two flights of stairs lead up to the balconies. Two doors also lead to the wings.   
We enter to western wing and are greeted with fungus stench. Musty. We made a rubbing of a plaque in this room. Found three silver inkwells which Maslin pocketed.      
The plaque is near a locked door. Kristif punches it, it holds but breaks a little.  
Creatures noticed us from the hallway. We tried to hide but made some strange noises. Threw rocks in our directions which we ignored. Three dog/hyena's entered the room and spotted us. Missed my initial ensnaring strike.     
We restrained a gnoll and left it in the west wing.  
Took a short rest, laid a trap.  Attempted a hostage exchange but it seems unlikely they understood. Splattered another six more after a brief fight.  
Eventually broke down the door to find a downward stairs. we checked the east wing first but found a giant wasp hive. Wasps the size of cats.   
We checked the balconies too.  from the vantage point, we observed a metal boat shape on the statues head. Possible giant clam shell. razor-clam shaped.   

Shared my knowledge about the wasps. Queens make nests. Maslins gusts the musty room. Made a body wall. and camp.      

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 21, (1059/8/21)
We descend the stairs. 3-4 floors. Found a stage with broken glass and sound proofing. Attacked by a glass tornado. Beat the air spirit. found another staircase that lead to the wasp room. The spirit left behind a small chunk of Magicite. Rumbling from the statue/golem. Craft shatters off and downs Kristif and Maslin. Statue is 15-16ft tall.
Janreth revived Kristif, I revived Maslin. The golem dealt a lot of good damage to us. We fled and camped to recover.
At camp Janreth played south Balthier with Kristif. I played my tune for the camp. Preston befriended Janreth. Maslin, Marlowe and I failed to collect food for the rest of us.

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 22, (1059/8/22)
We took another more prepared attack on the golem. I was immediately gassed. I recovered when maslin revived me. picked through the wreckage. Found a 3d map (orrery (yes somehow that's the correct spelling)) of the planet and moons. Metal conch-shell. Found curved machete blade no handle. also made from strange metals.
Golem heart is perfect sphere around large melon sized. Warm to the touch.       
Placed the heart in the indentation. The indentation opens to reveal faint blue tinted cave to circular chamber with lanterns below. Maslin is first down the hole. Vacant of occupants.
Short table with scrolls and books. All in this strange elven-ish script. Some pictures with diagram of planets and planar charts. Diagram of a planar gate. Water and supplies are in the barrel. Foods is 100+ yo.  no other exits. Next to the table  is two amethyst-ish crystals. Maslin took the two crystals.

We headed back to ice-end after taking a short rest.


## Blurnsday, Eleasias 23, (1059/8/23)
Arrival in ice-end imminent. Heavy rain.  
Spotted a large-ish rowboat. Possible for holding 12 humanoids. The ship is longer than the cedars we felled. Inside the boat chains w/ manacles and ropes. A few small weapons. Shields painted red and white. A collection of humans arguing. Bandits!

We ambushed them in the rain. Marlowe darkened the area. got fireballed but saved the throw. still not totally recovered. Interrogated Kyfin the slaver. Works for Ozzles. Ozzles works for clayson the slaver. We are taking the three of them as prisoners.        

We take the three of them back to the ice-end in their boat. We arrived by nightfall. Harbeck speculates that they may not have come upstream. The odd sword can connect psychically to it's owner. Can defend the owners mind. +1 Mind Blade. as versatile longsword +2 wisdom save.
We also talked to Drusilla.   


## Blurnsday, Eleasias 24, (1059/8/24)

We bought some items from Whitemoon Threads. Marlowe Interrogated Mordecai. Maslin gave a magecite to Elena to test amending the soil with. Spent the rest of the day resting. Left the remaining magecite with Rikki.  

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 25, (1059/8/25)

We headed out for worms lair. Didn't find any good grub. Smoked a lot of fish.

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 26, (1059/8/26)

Maslin finds a new berry in the shade knee high bushes growing shiny pink and maroon berries. Maslin nibbles the berry, finds it to be bland. I identified it as Salmon-berries.

## Blurnsday, Eleasias 27, (1059/8/27)

Arrived in late morning at the cedar forest. Annelida is living in a rotted tree. Kristif talks for us. Annelida tells us that the library and text is from old high-elf like civilizations. Annelida says that the barrier was keeping out extra-planar beings. They claim to be a scholar of ancient races. Gnolls are from the vast plains to the west. Annelida couldn't come here directly because the gates on this continent were closed. Weapons that the illithids/mind flayers used.


## Blurnsday, Eleasias 28, (1059/8/27)

also not great navigation. Janreth noticed steaming bubbles from a rippling water. Spotted a big blue centipede. Fought and bested the worm.

7th day
calm day of sailing

8th  
more calm sailing southern

9th  
a little more rough weather. spotted a structure on a hill. and a large human woman hauling a sea-lion corpse. She tells of a village (Algana) an hour inland. Kristif very painfully lost a wrestle with Greyvill.   
We dined at the the village. Village has a palisade and structures. A few dozen people and houses. This village is mostly using hunting to support settlement.  
Jotah is unaware of other human tribes. This tribe is native. Have lived here for centuries.  The goblin whaling grounds are two days south west of here.
Jotah claims there are no more magic users in the tribe. Druids lead the tribe here. The town druid Kirima had a disagreement with Jotah and was exiled. Perhaps that's his hut on the nearby hill. Referenced a "great down sweep". This peninsula used to be an island in an archipelago.
The rocky tower was visited by Kirima many times. Possibly cursed tower built by southerly orcs. Corrupted Kirima. The orcs attempt to take control of it.     
Maslin arm-wrestled and lost a buff child.  

10th  
alcohol Tarasun made from sea-lion. helps breakfast go down.

11th  
over landed west toward whaling grounds
ambushed! arrows. Beaten back handily. These goblins don't have have the clan red crater insignia.  
Marlowe harvested their brains.  

12th  
we stealthed towards the bay.

13th  
another stealthy approach to the bay. Heavy clouds and heavy rain but spotted the bay. Camped in the rain   


14th  
stealthy travel again southerly. Rain eventually let up. Spotted a carrack.  
Nicolo reports The Great Bear full of well armored humans. Dark blue flag with compass and scales. Indeed Corvaillian.  

15th  
travelled east. Ship sails south out of the bay. moved slower but more aware. Still raining. Even more rain and winds. approached a lonely ruined watch tower. Crown is smashed and ruined.  

16th  
Began journey into the tower. The tower is on the top of a hill. Very sparse trees. Wooden palisade around the tower. Two short houses by the tower base.   
House near the tower caught the collapse of the tower. Most of the rubble is on/in this house. Nicolo found yellowed bones with a small pierce of paper. Found a ruined journal.     
Southern house is run-down. Shutters banging. Three cots. I found a hollow floorboard which contains a leather pouch with 45 gold and 112 silver coins. Silver ring (finger bone included) and an onyx figuring of an elk. The elk is inscribed with "For papa from Ulia". It's probably worth 50gp and the ring 15gp. Kristif detects magic but doesn't find and magic.
We enter the tower. The door is relatively intact and even has some resistance. Interior is well preserved. Room lit by three bobbing orbs. Racks hold old swords and spears. Narrow spiral staircase going up AND down. Near the stairs is a dead armored orc skeleton. When Marlowe prods the desicated corpse, the lights bob out.   
The three lights are Willow Whips. Feed on the suffering of the prey. We defeated two of the wisps but lost track of the third.
Heard dripping water from downstairs. We then explored upstairs. Rubble strew about even the stairwell. At the top of the tower is a nest of rubble. The tower has a commanding view of the surroundings including a ruined shipwreck of a small boat. Scratched into a brick is the message "Tell my family I'm sorry. I must do this" in orcish.
We then descended to the first floor underground. A small dank dark room with a bit of water in the ground. Half dozen bloated rotten orc corpses in a few inches of water attract carrion bugs. Old barrels against the walls. Three corpses have axes. Janreth is reminded of her time in the war. Kristif investigates and finds chunks dissolved away from these very old corpses. At least two of the orcs had their throats slit. Found a zelda wall! The orcs begin to stir. We defeated the zombie but Maslin took some claws to the face.     
Kristif knocks away the fake wall and discovers a knocked out section. Stairs head downward to a cave section. Five foot in diameter.   
We take a short rest before spelunking. Staircase opens up to a worked natural cavern.     
Zombies be here.
Found a trashy hallway with recently extinguished torch. Orc in the tunnel. Korlash. Tendrils underneath the bridge. became nauseated. the tendrils are slimes which got caught on our caltrops. We are retreating. Down to zero health. We barely limped out way out of there.  
17th
Arrived at Algona village. Greyvill is out hunting. Chief Jotah welcomes us back and we shared our adventure stories. Jotah makes us a stew. Took a long rest.    

18th  
They have some ivory and jade to trade. Derwood leaves some brightweed behind. I foraged and we made our way back to the boat.
We navigated nicely up the coast back towards ice-end.  

19th    
Another uneventful day northward.  

20th  
Heavy eastern clouds bring torrential rains. Spotted more blue crabs. large humanoid, 12ft tall loping along the beach eating crabs. giant continues to eat crab at us and slapping his gut and hurls mud at us.  
We continue to sail through the night and arrive at ice-end early.

21th  
Conveyed our tales to Harbeck. Harbeck is strumming at a lyre. He did not like our like of progress. He told us to kill the giant when we see it. He also gave us two scrolls of Speak Language.      
Back on the farm, I promoted Allen to Senior Foreman.

22nd  
We forged out overland for goblin country bring salted fish. Dumping rain. The trees are turning bright orange and snow is climbing down the mountain.

23rd  
Encountered a mounded earth like something tunneled underneath.  

24th  
Well supplied, and well guided. Fast travel towards clan red-crater. Arrived at the foothills.  

25th   
Temperature is getting lower. Snows will be arriving in the plains within a month.

26th Elient   
Another beautiful day. One thicc grey cloud that turns out to be smoke. We traced the smoke to the goblin camp under attack but several dozen vespers of Corvail. Pair of supply wagons with Corvaillian flag flying. A few knights as well. A bare headed captain on a horse shouts commands. I cast fog cloud to disperse the combat. A half-orc named Tool showed up out of the blue.      
The goblins were glad to retreat. We negotiated with Tess to allow them to dock in ice-end and leaving the whaling grounds to the goblins. Tess wants and exchange of hostages.  
The goblins have honor but want their grounds, weapons, gear and livestock. Tess begins writing a treaty. Tess wants to bring the the ship the Great-bear and leave a token force to protect the ship.
Grukgruk is glad to survive and retake the whaling grounds. The treaty is signed and sealed with personal seals.   
Tess tells of an old tomb to the south-west. Just goblin. We sneaked a glimpse of the map, not many details but Fort Ten Candles.
We trekked towards the tomb and make camp. Found a gentle creek. To refill skins. Snow is creeping down the mountains. Unperturbed night.

## 27th Elient, 1059   
Torrential begins in the morning. Quite cold. Arrive at the tomb after following the river. Three weathered Burial mounds resemble topless pyramids.
We entered a tomb and found dancing shadows. We defeated most of them. Stairs led downstairs. Marlowe fell down the unseen stairs triggering darts. These stairs lead to a grand hall. In the hall is a headless statue with caskets who open and emerge. Ambushed by many skeletons and an Ice man. We sent him back to the portal.  
The statue has a shrouded female elven appearance with a bent head. He arms are outreached as if to hold something. One hand is on the ground. Detail work is elaborate and the statue is well preserved other than broken hand. Ensconced statues are of bent hooded figures with pointed faces. Holding bowls underneath faces. Decayed and not as well made. Coffins are made out of petrified wood and have ivy patterns engraved.
I found five secret doors behind the statues. We descended down one of the passages to find a number of runes in front of a another large statue. Each rune has a color. White runes blast out snow and ice. Blue is light damage. Red is flames. Purple is darkness that persists. No runes is a trap doors which do not close. Black rune glows blueish white.   
Niccolo reports that the statues arms have joints and could move. We decided to explore the other passages. Found a room with a hole that contained etchings of humanoid figures burying the dead. The wall etching shows this pit contains the beheaded figure. Overseeing the proceeding is the statued woman. Below the large woman is another large crowned man wearing a crown of thrones. The beheaders are three faceless humanoids and carry scythes.
Marlowe does find rotting bodies. Strangely fresh-ish. Greyish fluid on the twenty feet.  
Found another room with broken statues and columns. On the far end of the wall is a pair of petrified trees twisted together. A short hooded humanoid with purplish skins and tentacles. But not corporeal, but a spirit of one. Marlowe used the scroll of comprehend language to talk mentally to the illithid spirit.
The illithid is named theks. He came here to corrupt the tomb and and raise undead. A certain whyte became too strong and overthrew Theks. This was the ice-man. The Ice-man Oladon is tied to the Theks spiritually. A secret door was at the meeting place of two hallways. Theks does not recall the maiden whose statue is everywhere. Oladon has raised his own kin to guard the place. Theks seems to want to die if Oladon is killed.
Theks points to the trees to the South. He says that way will lead to the chamber. These stairs lead down to the room that Niccolo had already located.
We approached the statue again from the south this time. Janreth set up a rope swing. Kristif is first across and moves the arms. They glow blue white. We volunteered Niccolo to test the black-green runes. We all stood on all four runes and the door opened. We entered and Janreth slaughtered the all the zombies. Oladon summoned two rotting bears and a skeleton to protect himself.
We slayed Oladon and the temperature returned to normal. We didn't find anything particular interesting in the final tomb room. Another etching of the hooded woman. On the left of the woman is the elven seated figure with the ivy crown. He is facing across to the empty seat next to the woman which is bathed in darkness. The sarcophagi is ornate. Inside is no body but a have dozen peridot gems. As well as a single piece of magicite. Small hidden compartment which contains 3 foot wand colored cold blue and lined with brass. Also contained is Oladon's maul. Made completely of bone and petrified wood.  
Maslin is incapable of getting drunk for 19 days.  
All the undead is purged.  
We make camp and catch up with Tool. Had been a personal guard for a big family in Lothal city. Night is uneventful. Northerly wind is low.

## 28th of Elient  
Clear morning but high winds in the evening. Biting cold.

## 29th of Elient  
Raining and windy and cold.
A group of especially big brown bears is on the far side of the river. The four bears are fishing for hibernation. A matriarch bear is minding the smaller bears.   

## 30th of the Elient  
Warmer but raining. We continue to follow the river. A forest is on the other side of the river. A little ways ahead is the camp, our destination. A little fortified camp. Some small palisades.   
We were challenged at the gate. We enter and approach the captain's tent. Capt. Tess van Gerehold's tent is sparring with a few other soldiers.  
She offers us food, wine and promises to disclose the information we asked for. She toasts our success.  
Her quest is to retrieve an artifact of great power. It is shrouded in many unknowns. The Kenku guide "Snapper" is from Rookrustle north of ice end. Snapper's people have been guarding the codex for many hundreds of years. Their gods have tasked them to protect it. Snapper had been exiled from the village for an unknown reason. She is paying him for information. The codex may be connected to planar travel. Corvail is interested in using teleportation circles.      
She offers us the chance to join her quest in the spring. She pays us 600 gold.     
We made camp outside their camp.

## 1st of Marpenoth  
Weather is clear. We attempted a fast pace into the hills to the north. No major encounters.

## 2nd of Marpenoth  
We awake to heavy winds and rains. There is some heavy snow on the ground. We didn't make as much progress as we should have. Marlowe wanted to hunt a caribou so she shot it with a pair of eldrich blast. It detonated.

## 3rd of Marpenoth    
We hustled toward ice-end. We camped near the original ambush spot. The snow is just full snow sticking to the ground. At night, 4 sabertoothed-tigers attacked us. We ignited the grass but Janreth was able to put it out.

## 4th of Marpenoth   
The snow is less strong today. The snow is sticking even in the low lands. By nightfall we arrived at ice-end.   
Villagers are preparing for winter. The Briggs brothers are avoiding eachother and helping gather firewood. A palisade wall is being erected around the main collection of buildings.
We approach Harbeck at his manor. He invites us into his office to hear our tale. He's a little wary about how we made a treaty without his approval.   
Janreth proposes a early expedition to search for the codex. Harbeck won't send soldiers to Rookrustle before the Corvaillians arrive. Harbeck favors peace.   
Drusilla is injured from Steeltooth who ventured into town while we were gone.   
Harbeck re-meets Tool and extends the pioneer tract to Tool as well. Harbeck gives each of us 250gp bonds backed by Boundless Odyssey.    
The singletons visit Drusilla. Tenorio had been treating the wounds but Kristif still heals her a bit.  
Tool and Maslin head to Whitemoon Threads to identify the large wand.  
Mordecai and Ravanna are serving people. The wand provides some kind of armor. The maul is magical.  
Marlowe visits her family. Nicolo is making friends but Margareta is shy. Calvin had performed last rites for victims of Steeltooth.

## 5th of Marpenoth
Allen got a raise to 4sp a day, as with the others. He refused my offer of being paid in futures. Another session of goblin lessons with Dunbar and Janreth. day 3/100. He takes a pay decrease.    
Marlowe buys some toys for her children. Tool and Kristif drill with the militia for money. Marlowe makes plans to build a winter wonderland.  

## 6th of Marpenoth  
The Other Shoe returns! I collected my five chickens. The Other Shoe brings new settlers. A few humans and a female halfling. A pair of Dwarven identicle red-haired women who seem to be acquaintances of Harbeck. They show signs of being surveyors/cartographers. They fly the blue flag of Clan ____.     
We noticed a buff male human, carrying an enormous maul arrive as well.   
Corinne is here as well! She is relieved to be unloading the animals.  
Kristif bought a horse.
Maslin lead the party to Whitemoon where he bought a round for the house. The new colonists are here getting sorted. Maslin's 20gp buys 10 gallons of beer.    
Maslin introduced me to Patsy, the human wall. I offered to work, his land for a small cut of the profit. He seemed willing to hear me out. He admitted to being single so I invited him to the anniversary party, so perhaps he can mate up with Janreth.    
Marlowe talks to the cloaked halfling. She is hoping to find a playmate for Nicolo and Margareta. She is Mary-anna Redleaf. Avoids the company of others. While Calvin takes Margareta to bed but Nicolo and Marlowe talk to Tommy and Elenor as well.   
Tool seeks out Tommy the Carpenter. Tommy is alarmed by tool's presence at first. Elenor is very interested in stories of gore from Tool. Tommy is a follower of Apollo and excited to practice with Marlowe and Calvin.       
Kristif has tense conversation with the drunk Tenario. Tenario doesn't want to convert.    
Janreth plays cards with Patsy. I grinned and winked at Patsy.     


## 7th of Marpenoth  


## 8th of Marpenoth  


## 9th of Marpenoth  
Kristif and Marlowe attend Tenario's 9th day service. A few dozen attendees. Tenorio preaches on the protection of Aristle during winter. Tenario is either sober or well-concealing his inebriation.     


## 10th of Marpenoth  


## 11th of Marpenoth, 355th anniversary!  
Left Preston with Rikki. Tried to set up Patsy and Janreth but didn't seem to see too effective. Will try again later.  
Kristif got farming advice from Lydia. Lydia and Dunbar seem to be happy.  
Tool learned a little about Steeltooth from Drusilla. Tool and Ravanna bonded a bit.
None of the set ups succeeded.

## 12th of Marpenoth
Marlowe purchases the doll Mordecai had put together.   
We headed out toward Steeltooth's lair based on Drusilla's information. Clear skies mark our departure met with heavy snow in the evening.

## 13th of Marpenoth
Trudging through the snow. I remark that Steeltooth has probably not entered hibernation.


## 14th of Marpenoth
The snow continues. The snow is a few inches deep.   
Mid morning we find Steeltooth's lair. A large tree stands on the boulder which contains the great bear. The tree's trunk is around the size of a house.  


## 15th of Marpenoth  
The den is dank and stinks of bear poop. We quickly spotted and seemed to get the jump on it. The bear caught Tool pretty bad, but together we killed Steeltooth. Drusilla's arrow was exceptionally crafted. Steeltooth's steel tooth, was an old dagger.  
Many remains of the dead exist here along with 74 steel and 45 copper. Stamped with an axe.   
There is another downward cavern entrance which seems to be dreadful and toxic to the moss.  
This lead to a metal tunnel. We pressed on north in the metal tunnel. At an intersection, we discovered a loose rubbish wall.    
As Nicolo attempted to scout the opening at the top but was snatched by something. Tool, forced himself through the wall to reveal several metallic humanoid monsters. We defeated them handily. The room didn't reveal much, but I still took a short sword. The weapons are unusually stampless. I found a ruined gear assembly.   
Our loot is
```
Five wooden shields.
Two Mind Blades.
Five battleaxes.
Six longswords
Eight spears.
Six suits of studded leather armor.
Eight suits of damaged chain mail.
Nineteen 1lb bars of silver.
```
I donned the studded leather armor.

I can barely hear the scraping of claws to the south. Marlowe and I scouted ahead and discovered metallic creatures fighting four-legged gnolls. Marlowe fireballed them and I finished off the survivors with arrows.  
There is a stone arch in the room and a hole in the ceiling. A mosiac is carved into the arch. The rest of the room is exceptionally plain. The arch is the only decorated thing in the room.         
More exploration revealed giant metallic scorpions. some ruined, all motionless. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor. We headed back upstairs and found vats of liquid containing a greenish fluid with some pulp and bone.
Also found a surgery with corpses of abominations. Possibly found a lair.
Another room is a cell with dark red stains and a drain. Near the drain is two small shards of magicite.   
The dog creatures seem to lure us into a tendril trap. The tendrils have fur. The brain-beaks knock out Janreth so Tool and I oust them from Janreth.    
I am so shocked by the sights and sounds of this uttering monstrosity that I admit
that I froze up.
We discovered a fleshy golem in the an antechamber. In the room is a pool of cloudy water. The golem is a combination of flesh and metal. My arrows have no effect. The others downed the golem but the combat alerted the scorpion from below.

Marlowe was killed by a lightning bolt from the scorpion.  

Eventually the  let go of tool and we got out of there. Kristif cast a spell to
preserve Marlowe's body.       

## 16th of Marpenoth   
We just race homewards today.

## 17th of Marpenoth   
We arrived at ice-end. We didn't have enough gold to purchase the resurrection
ceremony outright so Tenorio allowed us to reduce the price to a third, for a total
of 500gp if we convinced Harbeck to allow Tenario to consecrate the town guards.
The guards and Harbeck seemed pretty open to the idea so we were able to obtain
the discounted price.
After a restless day we assembled for the final ceremony. As the ritual completed
a massive flock of crows forced their way into the church and began to devour the
corpse. They were shouting "Eat!" in Auran. We did our best to fight them off but
they were still able to consume most of her body. I disguised myself as a Kenku
and commanded them to leave to no effect.
I followed the corvids to a copse where they were regurgitating and dying. Their
vomit formed itself into a Marlowe who spoke! She seemed quite weak and claimed
to have spoken to Apollo. I gave her my cloak and led her back to the church to
reunite with her family.  

## 18th of Marpenoth   
I brought the Wodehouses some snacks. The town is largely in shock. Life returns to routine.
The exception being that Marlowe's daughter is missing.  

## 1st of Uktar (Day of the Restful Dead)   
Day of the Restful Dead is traditionally observed by refraining from all forms of
work. Derwood, fancies himself flat-out a fair-weather faith follower, fires up a fatty, feeds on fried fennel fritters and furrows his forehead into the fur of his feline friend.

## 2nd of Uktar - 10th of Uktar
Life in town continues with clear weather. Goblin lessons are going well and I expect
I will soon be able to carry on a slow conversation with a fluent goblin speaker.

## 11th of Uktar - 20th of Uktar
I am now a novice goblin speaker. Light snow into the middle of the week. The river
has not yet frozen over and people are continuing to .  

## 21st of Uktar - 30th of Uktar
Started a brewing company with Kristif. I collected Mistle-toe for goodberry and
created a lot of goodberries for goodberry wine. Kristif provided the labor and
I provided the coin and fruit.

## 1st of Nightal - 10th of Uktar
It's very much winter now. Days are short, cold and snowy. St. Reese is still too
cold to cross on foot.

## 11th of Nightal
We trekked out towards the forest to the north. I found a crossing near ice-end.
I lead the group with Nicolo tucked under my arm as a messenger to the rest of the
group. We rested in the day and resumed travel in the night.   

## 12th of Nightal
We went northwest. Encountered a half dozen flying fairies (sprites) with bows. The command me to stop in common. Their skin is light blue and their eyes are beady and red.  
They attacked me when I attempted to flee. While sustaining some cold damage, we ultimately
drove them off. Marlowe collected their brains.    

## 13th of Nightal
We headed North Left again. Marlowes map for this section looks like she overturned
the inkwell. Perhaps her eyes can differentiate the lands and grooves of the spill.
We found a creek which has seen better days. Appearance of a struggle. Kristif investigated
the mess and discovered sings of orc explorers and a lightly obscured orc camp.
Eventually we ran into a group of orcs winning a fight with a few kenku. Tool's
scouting failed with him being noticed. Marlowe and I climbed up an helped extracate
him, though Marlowe took two heavy axe attacks to the chest. I disguised myself
as a top-half-fish merman in a camoflauge cloak. After combat my eavesdropping
was ineffective on account of not speaking orcish.
We camped for the day back by the creek and heard the orcs travelling northwest.


## 14th of Nightal
We followed the orcs northwest and their tracks contained orge tracks but no
kenku tracks. Eventually we sighted their camp at a distance and came up with
a complicated plan to eavesdrop on their camp.
On approach we counted roughly three dozen orcs with a pair of ogres. Included
are bigger, heavily armored orc with a banner and the orc that was the victim
of Marlowes zombie.
The leader orc is planning on ambushing rookrustle as the orcs expect the defenses
are roughly equivalent.  
We concocted a complex plan to release the kenku prisoner.

The prisoner kenku has a broken beak and muscly arms and many wounds.
The plan succeeded! We freed the kenku "Blackblade" and he lead us to Rookrustle.

Rookrustle is a small town ringing a massive black tunnel. The Pit is exceptionally
deep. The Kenku have assembled some kind of on one side of the Pit.

Blackblade leads us to the town leader Storymaster who rallies the town defenders.
We lied the bird-people telling them that we are here to avenge our town who suffered
from a made up raid by these orcs.

## 15th of Nightal

We met the ogres at the southern part of town. Blackblade revealed his blade seems
to return to his hand after being thrown. We handled the group without much trouble
but it seems to be a diversion. The larger group of orcs attacked from the north
and have taken the ruined tower. A few kenku are attempting to hold a bridge.

After a short battle for the bridge, we advanced to clearing the tower. A few
of us climbed in the windows, kristif lifted the portculis on his own.
These orcs seem loyal to a "Jarl" in "Stormfjord".

We defeated the first group in the tower. The commander came in the second group.
This time we defended the tower. After a pitched battle, we slayed the orc commander
and forced the remaining orcs to retreat. I landed about five arrows but Maslin
landed the killing blow. This battle was fierce and several kenku fell.
Our party our did our best to down the retreating orcs but I fear of a counter-
attack.

A few orcs made it into the pit. Storymaster descended as well to deal with the orcs.
Blackblade trusts that he will be able to deal the orcs on his own. Wormbelly
tells us that the sanctuary indeed protecting the codex. While Storymaster is indeed
pwoerfull, the full strength of the orcs would have been too much.

We are exhausted and battle-weary. This was not the brisk venture I had envisioned
so many nights ago in Ice-end. We have all learned a valuable lesson about what happens
when we leave ice-end. We passed out in nests of hay.

## 16th of Nightal

After a well deserved rest, Wormbelly gives us a bag of gems, and the town's
alchemist gave us a few potions.
Maslin talked to Bubblemaker, Marlowe had a discussion with Wormbelly while the
rest of us continued packing for the return to ice-end.  
Storymaster is an inherited position. When Storymaster passes, Wormbelly will
gain Storymasters conscious and role.  
Wormbelly hesitates and pecks at her shoulder in a simbol of discomfort before
telling Marlowe that these Kenku were created by the Foremind for the purpose of
protecting the Planar Codex. The Foremind is the greating intellect that has ever
been known.
Marlowe peddles Apollo to Wormbelly's mild mechanical interest. The Kenku still holds
the omniscient Foremind in higher regard.
She also relays that kenku that shirk their duties to protect the foremind, are
exiled and shunned from the settlement.
The more relegious amoung us continued to flap their lips and beaks about gods
and worship.
We also decided to join Maslin in talking with Bubblemaker. Bubblemaker is the
towns alchemist and sorcerrer. She is eccentric and interested in blood.
In her hut is live Cialla, a rare flower. It has between five and seven petals.
If properly distilled, it can grant visions of another, possibly paralelle world.
She offers Monk's hood tea. Blue hooded flowers. This tea, will create a relaxing
calming sleep aid. I traded some bubonic chronic and gang-of-Tanqueray for the tea.
She is seeking manticore barbs but no one in town will venture out to get them.
Manticore barbs almost never go bad but are really poisonous. Manticores can be
found to the south-west of rookrussel.     
Blackblade thanks us and we make our farewells as we head for ice-end.


## 17th of Nightal
Nothing of note in our journey towards home.


## 18th of Nightal
Arrived at the outskirts of ice-end and we encounted a few local hunters.  
They are hunting a large caribou.   
We arrive to the town mid-day and deliver our report to Harbeck. They we meet
the Stenberg sisters. The Stenbergs are known for their copper and tin mining
business.
They are here to tell about a potential claim west of here. Harbeck reached out
to find a good place to start mining. They know of a site a few days west with ruins
and iron, gold and other valuable minerals.
My attempts to set up Kristif and Tool with the sisters, again fall on deaf ears.


## 20th of Nightal
Kristif made a barbaric animal sacrifice that at least reinvogorated him.
This winter is unusually dark. We are all doing our best to keep warm.
An aurora dances accross the north-western sky. I'm sure Marlowe and Kristif
will read something significant into this phenomenon, but it sure is pretty.
As Aurora grows with the wind, we hear snow crunching and spot several large
hulking creatures lumbering into the village. The guard is rallies and we see a half
dozen of these montrosities, march toward us. Shadowed by heavy snow and illuminated
by the aurora, behind the golems, a slender elven figure, gilded in leaf-like armor
and sporting a floral crown. The figure floats above us and it's ice-blue, weaping,
eyes pierce our gazes. The eyes are paired with tears as the golems attack villagers.
The male figure disappears and the north-west and the aurora follows.

Captain Pybba proved his mettle in the combat. Maslin cast Fly on Tool but the
ice-beasts detonated when killed. We slayed them without too much trouble. Tenorio
aslo showed some martial aptitude.

Kristif notes that ice-elf must be immensely powerful. He believes that this may
have been a test from the old god "Auril".

We decided to wait out a week and send Drusilla to ask the Algonions

## Week of the 20th of Nightal  
I decided to join the watch and patrol town. Another pair of eyes can't hurt.
Kristif drilled the guards. Maslin worked with Janreth on translating some of
the strange elvish texts from the library in the woods. Tool prospects .

## 30th of Nightal  
Drusilla has returned! She had checked in with the chief. It's not uncommon for attacks
on the equinox due to the long nights but they had not encountered night-elves.
Drusilla got an odd feeling about Algana. Some of the people maybe don't blink.

## 1st of Hammer, of the year 1060  
We set out for Algana to check up on the strange villagers. We are bring metal
tools to trade.   

## 3nd of Hammer  
Kristif bores us with tales of Auril, who used to serve Talos.
The weather is turning against us, and we had to camp early.

## 4th of Hammer  
Marlowe told me that her daughter is missing. She is under the illusion that her
daughter is in the care of Apollo.    

## 5th of Hammer
We arrived at Algana. Ever the guards have noticed the coldness of the citizenry.  
Tool quickly forgets about Janreth as the two wrestle. Janreth will be devastated.  
Chief Jotah thanks us for the metal gifts and Maslin inquired about the state of  
the village.     
Jotal says that some of the older folks enter spells of daze. They stare off into
the distance and smell of old eggs.  
Maslin collected a crowd and I played a tune on my lute for them. I swear the cold  
was messing with my fingers. After the show, Tool noticed someone sneaking towards
Marlowe. Tool confronted them pretending to recognize them. The blonde male attempted  
to charm Tool but he noticed the deception and responded with an uppercut. However  
the blow is met with a semi-solid matter in humanoid form. After being discovered,
the creature melted into the ground as well as four other former members of the  
village.    
Jotah is horrified. Searching around, there are a few small holes about an inch  
wide. All of their clothes and effects melted with the villages. Tool gets to digging
with our shovel on one of the holes but fails to find anything interesting.      
We remained to investigate the home of a couple who just lost a person to melting.  
The couple appears fine and unaware of anything strange. I interrogated the husband  
and as he attempted to charm me as well. So I whipped out my dagger to barely  
scratch the creature which sent him and his wife back to the ground. Fast-handed
Marlowe managed to catch a bit of it in a jar. We will surely have to revisit
the tower.

## 6th of Hammer
Windy but the snows have slowed.

## 7th of Hammer
High winds and light snow.

## 8th of Hammer (Full moon)
We slept under an eirie silence. There are no sounds of life, only the crashing of  
the waves and scream of the wind.   
We spotted fresh tracks, or bear, wider humanoid heading to and from the tower.   
There are no willow wisps or orc corpes.  
The water on the ground floor have frozen over and the there are some oldish  
tracks in the ice.
I triggered a pressure plate and it threw me into a pit with an ooze. Kristif  
lowered a rope, and I was able to Zephyr my way out of out of the pit.  
During a fight with some zombie creatures, Marlowe spotted a small brown-haired  
female child chained to the wall. It melted through the floor but we all had a  
good feeling about the kid.    
Tool pried open a door and found the bodies of the two elderly villagers from  
Algana in a pile of corpses. In the room, we found a force rod which Maslin  
made me drop. Moving on, Tool and Marlowe got caught in a gelatinous cube.  
Korlash was expecting us and a brawl ensued. He attempted to cast a spell on us,  
but Maslin countered it. Instead I ensnared Korlash with a rose thorn arrow, and  
Kristif detonated him. His brain attempted to run away on chicken legs but Kristif  
caught it with something religiousy and killed it.

We discovered a few cages with some livestock. 2 goats and a few fowl.  

Malowe collected the dead brain. We discovered the brain running towards a room    
with an odd Large cyclinder, with a pair of humans confusedly looking at us.  
They are the couple from Algana. They drop the ruse, and admit to their gelatinous  
beings. They claim to be constructed by the old masters of this place. They  
feast on memories. The child says she ate some of our memories. Korlash's brain  
is a servant of the Illithid.      
The remaining goos, will need to feed on higher life forms' memories to sustain  
them selves. They refer to themselves as the Oblex?
We decided to allow them to live, as long as they stay away from our allies, and
directed them to Fort Ten-candles.

Maslin attempted to snuff out the remaining Black Puddings but instead was knocked
out by their buffers and acid. Tool retrieved him from the oozes but his armor  
was severely damaged and he was nearly slain himself. We made a hasty retreat.
Lesson learned. Live and let ooze.


## 10th of Hammer
Cheif Jotah gave us a warm welcome, and bequethes his line's amulet to the group.
We will rest here until tomorrow before we set out again for ice-end.

## 11th of Hammer
Our return journey to ice-end commences with heavy snow in the afternoon.
It was decided to pick up our pace and travel through the night towards home.

## 12th of Hammer
Our party got bogged down in a blizzard an we weren't able to make as much progress
as we hoped.

## 13th of Hammer
The snow grows even stronger today and it becomes a struggle just to march.


## 14th of Hammer
Our party is more than happy to finally arrive at home in ice-end. The town is
quite but as expected. Smoke from chimneys indicates warmer families.


## 15th of Hammer
We spent some time in town crafting a bag of holding and some downtime activites.


## 24th of Hammer
I spent the week training unimpressed guards.

## 25th Hammer - 3th of Alturiak
This week I spent training Marlowe in the way of nature.

## 4th of Alturiak
We sent Drusilla to warn the kenku of the spring raid.

## 5th of Alturiak - 6th
Travel noises
Maslin names the pass, Keswick canyon


## 7th of Alturiak
We made camp under a overhead cliff. At the campsite were two piles of snow concealing
steam monsters from the beach. One hurt Kristif pretty bad, but in the end we defeated
them. Tool spotted a larger source of steam farther to the west.

## 8th of Alturiak - 9th
Travel noises.
We spotted a goblin patrol but avoided them.
Large Wolftracks, but no wolves as well.


## 10th of Alturiak
Kristif and Tool heard a faint voice of a woman calling for help on the wind.
Kristif didn't detect any magic, the voice seems to be leading us back north.
Kristif also discovered a single pair of hoof tracks leading toward a copse of
trees. Eventually we gave up on the tracks and made camp. The animal trap, was
triggered on the windegoe who had been stalking us.


## 11th of Alturiak
We made it to the river near the corvale war camp.

## 12th of Alturiak

Kristif spotted a hole in the ice on the river with a pair of humanoid legs sticking
out. The legs are frozen and unmoving. Red trails lead away from the body.
Six humanoid tracks are found. Kristif pulled the human out of the river, possibly
a wizard. The corpse had some small trickets and coins. The coins indicated free-city
origin.
We decided to slow our roll and move with stealth for the rest of the day.
By nightfall we spotted the war camps structures. Tomorrow we will keep an eye
on the camp and send a scouting party of Marlowe and I at night.



## 13th of Alturiak

We approached the camp stealthily and spotted around 20 knights of corvale with
a few horses. 6 heavily armored knights including the commander and 15 foot soldiers.
We executed a complicated infiltration and slayed all of the corvaleans. Marlowe
had a close call after revealling her position to cast a very powerful fireball.
While one of the horses was caught in the conflagration, I was able to calm
the remaining horse we have named "Loud Bear" in honor of Operation Loud-Bear.
Marlowe found a map in the camp. This camp was named Skwentna Point/Basin.
We also recovered ten brassy tokens which we had noticed the soldiers using to
open the camps gate. They are stamped with a golden horn.
As we left we arranged the bodies in a circle with a vaguely occult-ish feel.  
Maslin also left the ruined journal from korlash's tower. I did my part by carving
cryptic messaging in orcish on wood in the camp. "There all is aching!",


## 14th of Alturiak

We are now travelling at night towards the hut between the Point and Ten Candles.
Following the river we reached the ocean to the south.


## 15th of Alturiak

Turnign west we seek the hut on the map. Later in the day, we spotted a settlement
a few miles away to the west.

## 16th of Alturiak

Tonight we are sneaking into the settlement. It is a village in a valley between
two hills. A little smaller than Ice-end. The area is greyish and there is no
smoke from chimneys.

## 17th of Alturiak


## 18th of Alturiak
We spotted the square wooden castle of Ten Candles. 15 foot high walls with 30ft
towers on the corners. The walls are around 200 ft long. This appears to only
serve military purposes.
We approached the fort slowly following a river. Marlowe an I donned our disguises
and I was able to deftly infiltrate the fort. I was unable to find anything particularly
useful but I counted around a hundred chairs in the great hall.


## 19th of Alturiak
Our party followed the river to the bay. We found the Great Bear


## 20th of Alturiak
We attacked the camp at the bay. It was a bloody battle and Kristif was breifly
knocked out. Soon after we dispatched the shore crew, the Great Bear raised alarm
and anchor. Tool managed to tear a hole in the port side, but I was hit with two
ballista bolts. It was a rough night.  


## 21th of Alturiak
Marlowe and I approached the grey village on our way back to ice-end.
The trees are dead and petrified and that's why the villiage is so ashen.
There is a stark border between the living and the dead trees. None have leafs
but the trees are still mostly intact.
I found a brassy amulet in the shape of the sun. Similar to Marlowes. We attempted
to communicate peacefully with some hooded light-emitting beings, but they attacked
us so we left.

## 22th of Alturiak

## 23th of Alturiak
homewards

## 24th of Alturiak
Near the old corvalian camp, moving northwest towards the forest.
The horses were spooked and kristif was thrown from the sadle.
Crashing noises are still approaching from the west. The air is getting chilly.
A blueish grey troll is chasing us. Kristif chickened out and the hairy witness
was left with only our tracks in the snow.

## 25th of Alturiak


## 26th
We crossed through the pass. There is only a little snow. In the evening we spotted
a griffon flying some distance to the northwest. It seemed to be carrying a reindeer.

## 27th

## 28th
Nice weather. Only a few days from Ice-end. Another griffon sighting!. They are
getting closer to town.

## 29th
Another good day for traveling.

## 30th Alturiak
Arrival at ice-end! Almost a month of our absense was noticed by the community
and we are all glad to be back. Pybba alerts us that there is a visitor from
Rookrustle and Harbeck has requested our audience.
Wormbelly arrived a week ago, she seeks assistance defending against a Corevale
invasion.
Greville and Drusilla attend as well. Lady Cliffsend has been in communication
with Harbeck. She has declared the Corevale as an enemy of the Empire, and we are
ordered to eliminate them. Lady Cliffsend is pleased with our progress, both in
damaging Corevale's foothold in the continent as well as driving the goblins of
red crater away from the colony. Algana and Rookrustle have also provided a few
warriors to assist us.  
Wormbelly tells us that Snapper has betrayed Rookrustle by leaving but also by
swearing to destroy the village. He had entered the Secret Chamber. It is critical
that snapper be destroyed.    



## 1st of Ches
We spent some time in town making purchases and gathering our mettle.


## 2nd of Ches
Towards Keswick's Canyon we marched towards.

## 3rd of Ches

## 4th of Ches

## 5th of Ches

## 6th of Ches

## 7th of Ches
We arrive on the seventh and the infantry set to creating fortifications.
Marlowe and I set up a FOB an hour south to watch for the incoming army.

## 8th of Ches

## 9th of Ches

## 10th of Ches

## 11th of Ches

## 12th of Ches

## 13th of Ches
We finally spotted the corevale army from the south. Around 300 armored
footsoldiers with cavalry support approach.
Marlowe and I returned to our defensive positions.
During the pitched battle, the birds performed admirally, Van Gerhold was slain,
and her army routed.
This has caused some tensions with Lothal and Corevale. As a result Harbeck is
feeling a bit more pressure to produce wealth and magicite


## 14th - 19th of Ches
[travelling noises]


## 20th of Ches
We arrived back in ice-end and held a big party to celebrate our victory.

## 21 - 30th of Ches
In the week before planting season, I tought survival skills to Marlowe.
Meanwhile the prospecting party found an abandoned mine to the west.


## 1st - 10th of Tarsakh
The growing season has begun! Preston purrs with excitement and to my surprise
Allen also trembles with anticipation. Considering his previous reservations,
this is a welcome change. The winter has built up a considerable fertilizer
supply in the barn.

## 11th of Tarsakh
We decided to head to the Manticore nest.


## 14th of Tarsakh
We crossed the river and are close to the manticore nest.

## 15th of Tarsakh
Arrival at the Manticore nest. We defeated the pair of manticore and headed for  
rookrustle.  


## 18th of Tarsakh
Arrival at rookrustle.  


## 23rd of Tarsakh
Arrival at ice-end.

## 24th of Tarsakh
We spent a day of downtime. RnR.

## 25th of Tarsakh
We began our trip towards the dungeon.

## 26th of Tarsakh
Travelling.

## 27th of Tarsakh
Travelling. Spotted a post-hibernation brown bear

## 28th of Tarsakh
Travelling. Wolves are near-ish.

## 29th of Tarsakh
Travelling.

## 30th of Tarsakh
Arrival near the grey village.

## 1st - 3rd of Mirtul
Marlowe wants to communicate with the hooded figures again.
However when we arrived we spotted three tribal looking figures prostrate pointing
toward the sun. They are approach unblinkingly. Marlowe charmed the leader with
her new ring and exchanged mumbo-jumbo with the leader. There is a servant to the
unconquered one, which they have not seen below the temple. They begin demanding
blood sacrifice. His name is Usdine.
The hooded figures have drawn three pointed stars around themselves which Marlowe
tells us is a sign of the enemy. However Marlowe was able to talk her way in and
we were able to enter the longhouse without being attacked. Inside the longhouse
are small piles of snow and ice along with braziers burning white and yellow.
We also descended down the large stone staircase. The holes in the ceiling are
perhaps a sort of astrolabe. After some way we entered a cold chamber with a few
statues. The NW statue is an armored figure in a striking pose with a three pointed
star on his chest. It looks like he was also carrying something glass in his off-hand
which is now broken. The statues are all exceptionally sculpted. SW is a humanoid
woman.
We fought and defeated demon named En-Men-Gal-Ana.
We found a well stocked library with books written in common. We estimate the books
are around 1500 years old. None of the books reference Etruria. We already know
that Etruria was discovered surprisingly around 50 years ago.   
We appropriated some funds of the property of "Warden Helene - Defense Funds"
This is where we found The Golden Fish Mask.
-----
We defeated a group of undead with golden winged helmets. We also picked up a
large iron key in the southernmost chamber. Maslin discovered scratches on the
chamber walls suggesting that someone was dragged into the southernmost room.
Only on sarcophagus is not opened in the northern chamber and there is a switch near
the gates in each chamber. By flipping all of the switches at the same time,
we opened a panel on the sarcophagus. On the panel are nine buttons.
We also found a key-rack labeled "Shadekeeper's Keys" in a room with fresh-ish
blood. On another wall we discovered gold inked, in common:
"At sun’s rise, life begins. At sun’s set, life ends. Lay thy dead here beneath
 the shadows of mine glory, and know that though the shade is darkness unseen,
 and that the shade is cold unfeeling, and that the shade is life’s repose.
 But know also that the light is built upon the shade, and the light does not
 forget the shade, and that though the shade and the light shall never touch,
 they shall know one another, as you know me, and as I know you, and as I know
 your shade."
We encountered A red-skinned man watching a woman dancing seductively with a few
demons. They are Sinnashi and his wife Ali-Ahhusha. They claim ignorance of the
blood trail.  Sinnashi is wearing a tarnished silver necklace. Sinnashi gave us
a strange key that resembles a wave.
After resting in the hot demon room, Tool went off on his own to a changing room
to the west. Inside the room is a strange figure, babbing non-sense and covered
in eerie shade. His eyes are totally black. We killed it after it attacked us.    
Descending into the tunnels below the first level, it is a cramped space. We
surprised a group of human knights assisted by an archer and a cloaked figure.
They are led by Elisha Mahalath, priestess of Auril. Apparently this "god" is
similar to Kristif's Talos and the two establish report. Auril's supposed domain
is cold weather.    
Maslin and Elisha exchanged dungeon facts. The three pointed is the symbol of
the Order of the Golden Dusk. She also mentioned a chained demon, a torturer on
this level. The sauna demon are Cambions, a kind of teifling-human hybrid.   
Elisha was kind enough to dispel the charm on Tool. Waking up, he relays that
he was commanded by Ali to prove his strength and then start the steam.
Elisha also queries Marlowe for her knowledge of Saint Gevurah, a founding member
of the church of Apollo. The saint ascended to serve at the side of Apollo. Elisha
believes this dungeon was built to contain demons and to store the bodies of the
saint and the angel. She suspects that the demons have successfully mutinied.
According to her, we need to destroy two of his items to release him; the crown
is one.
Remember to identify the spear that the chain demon dropped.
--------
The scroll tells us that the spear is the Spear of the Vengeful.
We encountered a group of large insectoids, which we were able to back away from
without harm to either side.
After much goading, I convinced the armored among us to lead the way. I have
been burned, including literally, too many times to lead the way again, but
Kristif and Tool show very little initiative.
Eventually finding our way into a courtroom from the prison. The ten-foot poll
was useful for pushing the tall ones into a room to the north and finding some
zombies. After slaying them, the room revealed a message scrawled above the
entrance to the courtroom.
"The burning light of noontide dispels all shadow, revealing all to the eye of the Sun."
As well as another message above another door
"Herein lies the mortal shell of Saint Gevurah, ascended in Everservice to the Unconquered Sun."
We looted a strange cloak from a storeroom near the steam room and prepared ourselves
to fight the dancing demons. Fortunately they heard reason and gave up their amulet
without a fight. Lucky that we didn't drink that potion of power.
Elisha led our group the main alter of the Saint, to rebind him. After some woo-woo
chanting, the saint arrives out of thin air. The Saint mentioned someone named
Godfrey and Anumantor: "The true lord".  
<hr>
Elisha mourns her fallen child, Morritz. Margereta has also reappeared, with her
horns and wings revealed. Apparently we all just didn't notice all this time.
Margereta leads us to Gevurah, and starts destroying artifacts. After a bit of
confusion, we figured out how to reveal the actual sarcophagus (casting light
upon it (obvious in retrospect)). We looted some gems and a strange spear/lance.
We used our last scroll of identify on the spear, which is the Skyblinder Staffspear.



## 4th of Mirtul

Left for ice-end. Elisha is also joining us.

## 10th of Mirtul

Arrival at Ice-end.
Rikki and I have decided to host Margereta since she has disavowed her father.
She is using her newly discovered wings to practice flying.
Alisha has also been visited by the flying crying elf.


## 11 - 30 of Mirtul
I purchased a recipe of an Alchemy Jug from a new enchanter in town and spent
the next two weeks building it.

## 1st of Kythorn
We decided to visit Harbeck with the purpose of joining a magicite expedition.
Harbeck trusted us enough to put us in charge of the entire expedition! He gave us
400 gold to hire workers and supplies. We hired the miners
-	Sarai Tallfellow, Female Halfling
-	Eridred Rubyeye, Female Dwarf
-	Rolen Jenkins, Male Half-Elf
-	Huru Presley, Female Half-Orc
-	Norman Fawcett, Male Human

as well as  
- Patsy (Marlowe's friend)
-	Radomir Kettlewhistle, Male Halfling
-	Leshanna Selevarun, Female Elf
We expect the journey to take 50ish days

## 2nd-17th of Kythorn
Travelling noises

## 18th of Kythorn
We travelled along the St. Reese as far as we could. The forest is still familiar
but we are closing in on the unknown. Eventually we were bogged down by rain and
uncertainty. Maslin fooled a gang of gryphons into leaving us alone but strange
flying manticores with humanoid pilots saw through our my deceptions and descended
on us.  
Maslin inspected a few coins in their pockets but couldn't determine their mint
origin. The closest approximation is the Hobgoblin place Var Galaria.

The Stenbergs then showed us to the mine about an hour away and we found three potential sites.
- 1st site is on a plateau near the mine and trees. Most defensible.
- 2nd site is very close to the mine, near a brook flowing very close to the mine.
- 3rd site is a bit distant from the mine, but a glade in the forest with lots of tree
cover with signs of game.  

We chose the third site for its air cover.


## 19th of Kythorn

Mine day! Around the entrance to the mine is old equipment and mine-cart rails.
Inside the mine we discovered dog-sized creatures eating away at metal.
We were ambushed by a monster disguised as a stalactite.
<hr>

We moved deeper into the mine and attacked a snail that was eating Magicite on the
walls of a large cavern. Since the creature had not attacked us, Tool intervened
when we attempted to attack the other snail. The second snail retreated into its
shell.
A pair of umber hulks bore through the wall behind Kristif and I and attempted to
burrow into us as well.
<hr>
Kristif wants to domesticate the rust monsters. She befriended one and named it crunchy.

## 20th of Kythorn

We are re-entering the mine. The rust monsters are wary but looking for snacks from
Kristif. We discovered a few chewed up corpses. Concerning. Inside the tunnels we
found also iron ore and glowing mushrooms. We followed a strange creature which lead us into
a trap hole. Marlowe cast fireball to clear out the hole, but the gases released
from zombies inside detonated and set us alight. We also seemed to have found a
source of natural gas.
Eventually we reached the end of the mine and a set of metal doors by a flail-snail.
With great effort Tool was able to pry the doors open to reveal a massive cylindrical
chamber. Inside are shards of magicite and three swarms of crownless rats. After
the last rat had been dispatched, we inspected the cylindrical room. It is 60ft
tall with 8 divets at each 5ft or so. We eventually gave up on trying to understand
the odd room and decided to leave the mine.
 Loot:
 Inside are several small paper notes, marked with different tallies (primarily increments of 5 and 10) and each has a small elaborate inking of horses on a large plain accompanying a script that seems to be a combination of dwarven, human, and hobgoblin. There are 1200 of each kind of note (totalling 3600), each marked with tally sets of 5, 10, and 20.
Chalcedony (50 gp), Chrysoprase (50 gp), Citrine (50 gp), 2 x Sardonyx (50 gp), 2 x Star rose quartz (50 gp).
<hr>



We returned to the freshly named Camp Crystal Lake. We also made plans to build
a more permanent structure.


## 21st of Kythorn - 3rd of Flamerule
Miners mining, Maslin, Tool and I surveyed. Kristif was logging.

## 22nd of Kythorn (the summer solstice)
Out of nowhere the weather turned south and snow began to fall. It got noticeably
colder. It even sneaked up on Kristif's weather sense.  Large White wolves  
approach. Towards the end of the fight, an aurora appeared seemingly to bring a  
tall and lithe elf-figure. His eyes are pale blue orbs, he is wearing long white  
robes and a silver crown. He called us desecrators.  
He showed as a model city in the snow. A massive elven city greater than any I had
ever heard of. In the presentation, massive flying nautilus destroy the cities  
airborne artillery. The elves were then turned against eachother. He claims the
invaders with led by mindflayers. The city was named "Methyr Tynylhoff".   
He gave us an ultimatum to leave in a week, which we are unable to abide so
instead we made plans to fight.

##2nd of Flamerule
The miners and guards are taking cover in the mine. We have built a massive bonfire  
and are awaiting the return of the Weeping Prince "Aleuwyn". Kristif was turned to
ash by a lucky strike from the Prince before he escaped.
<hr>

## 4th - 19th of Flamerule
Traveling noises.

## 20th of Flamerule
Arrival at Ice-end. Surprise! Kristif is here and alive. He's sheepish about how
he was revived. We celebrated his return and the completion.

## 21st of Flamerule
Harbeck gave us 1% share in the mine
An orc trader has arrived, Ulric Woodleaf with many interesting items on his ship
the Windfall. The steel longbow in particular caught my eye. It is pricey but had
divvied up some extra coin from the common fund. Kristif and I put up 1k gold to
finally bring the Blacksun Yarn into existence. Construction of the brew-house will
be complete on 31st of Eleasias.

## 21st of Flamerule to 9th of Eleasias
Training stealth with Marlowe in exchange for training nature for Marlowe.
I sold some magicite for 1400gp.
<hr>
Lady Cliffsend arrived in the colony about The Persimmon galleon. The ship is
enormous. He retinue includes a number of knights, a pair of mages and a priest of
apollo. She resides in Harbeck's residences. She will hold court here for three
months administering her lands. She isn't known for fighting but for diplomacy   
skills.
We are summoned to her court, Harbeck's office, where his desk and piled into a
corner. She is curious about the local populations and the situation here in
general. I gifted her our captured corevalean robes.
She mentioned vastly increasing the size of the colony as well as setting up
villages at the other mining sites.
We made tentative plans to travel to the west, reconnect with Janreth and Annelida
as well as make peace with the nearby humans near crystal lake.

## 10th of Eleasias
Rikki and I had a nice visit from Marlowe who was concerned about Margereta
sneaking out of the house at night. I reassured her that Preston was keeping watch
of her and we went back to nature and sneaking lessons. I also set out some
scarecrows of various sized out for   

## 9th - 19th of Eleasias
Another week of downtime while Kristif continues to recover from his violent
resurrection. We started planning a journey, first to the library ruins where we
expect to catch up Janreth and Annelida.

## 23rd of Eleasias
The journey went smoothly but I spotted a large white flying object in the sky.
We went to the Annelida's tree and encounted Janreth who let us know that the pair
had made a major breakthrough. The two have been living in a hollowed out tree.
She says they should be able to translate most of the text in the library. The  
text describes how to perform a planar shift teleport. The writers were attempting
to transport their entire people and land elsewhere. The pair attempted claimed
the writers wanted to banish extraplanar beings. This explains the libaries
barrier.  
Janreth and Annelida believe the writers had several locations constructed to
connect to the weave. Aleuwyn must have backfired the spell and allowed alien
invasion. They suggest visiting one of the sites a good deal to the northwest.
Follow the source of nearby river.
Janreth seems to mostly trust Annelida. With her work mostly completed, she agreed
to join us on our journey to end up back at ice-end.

## 27th of Eleasias
More traveling. Due to some navigation errors, we encountered another stormray
and two mole monsters. We won the fight but took some bad hits. We captured two
of the riders to interrogate but they were very cheeky. They claim to be Nieryet.
Their leader is named Firefist. They worship the sun-god Gok-Tske. The two
capitves are named Okin and Chimbai. Their settlement is called Tumen Ord.    
<hr>
The pair claim the tribe does not to attack useful trading partners and subjected
lords. For example the Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha) create fancy trinkets for them.
We decided we didn't want to go all the way to Tumen Ord and back so we cut the
pair loose and told them we would be back. They told us where their camp was and
that is our new destination.

## 1st of Elient
We arrived at the camp. On the journey, Marlowe nearly passed out from heat
exhaustion on the hottest day of the year for the purpose of celebrating some
deity. She even reported strange visions like it was normal.
The camp is in an old set of tunnels. Approaching in the morning I spotted some
humanoid recent tracks of a at least a dozen goblins and orcs. We also noticed
giant bootprints of something very tall.
I cast Pass Without Trace and we followed the tracks to a camp. At the camp Tool
failed to talk his way into getting some information from them. Their camp has
copper colors banners with a serpentine head on them. A small copper dragon begins
to approach the camp where there is also a hill giant.
Marlowe and I probed their defenses invisibly but couldn't find a way in. After
some communing with a higher power, we were compelled to attack the camp anyways
for cash which was very out of character for our group.
<hr>
During the altercation, a spellcaster appeared and which excited the goblins who
responded by chanting "Lumzu! Lumzu!" Tool stomped on some trained centipede attackers.
Following retreating goblins we ended up in a fight with a bronze dragon. We killed
it but it was close.
We retrieved a key from a minic key-keeper for a very well fed treasure room.

## 2nd of Elient - 13th of Elient
Began heading back to ice-end with a bullete we rescued from the cave.
We had an incident where Unbridled Dave almost ran off due to the sudden presence
of a pack of wolves.

## 14th of Elient
Arrival at Ice-end. We conveyed our success to Harbeck and Lady Cliffsend. Maslin
accepted a Barony from his uncle.

## 14-24th of Elient
Training in town stealth.
<hr>

## 25th Elient
We discussed a plan with Harbeck to hire 20 laborers to mine, guard and construct in camp crystal lake. It will cost 2720 out of the common fund.

Maslin accepting the title of Baron from his uncle and conveyed his intent to create a safe haven for magic users across the St. Reese.

We begin our journey to Crystal Lake.

## 25th of Elient - 9th of Marpenoth
Traveling

I spotted a small herd of Mammoths heading towards us. Maslin blew them away from us while Tool led the party away from them.

## 9th of Marpenoth
The camp has started to return to nature but there remains the skeleton of the structure. We left Patsy in charge and camped a night here. Kristif brought Crunchy to help detect metals.

## 10th of Marpenoth -
Departed for Tumen Ord on directions from our captives following the St. Reese.

Tool encountered a trio of bears and we killed two but we intimidated one away from the group. We crossed the St. Reese with the help of a Waterwalk.

After breaking camp one day, we were set up by a group of humans. Mostly humans riding horses there is also a hobgoblin and a few halflings riding war-dogs. The riders do not resemble Tumen Ord members. They have horsehair tassels.
<hr>
They are the Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha). One rider is their leader. When they reveal themselves to be non-threating Maslin and Marlowe reveal themselves and greet peacefully. The leader is named Barta Khonghar and we are on their lands. They advise us on not heading into Near-Yeet territory. Barta says the Near-Yeet are oath-breakers and not to be trusted.

Tumen Ord are a breakaway tribe from the Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha). The riders are in the process of hunting monsters and Maslin offers to assist with the hunt. Their armor has a more a lived in look.

They lead us rapidly without stopping and eat in the saddle. We rode for longer than we expected. They tell us we are hunting trolls.

## 11th of Marpenoth
The riders broke camp real fast, barely giving us enough time to set the Alchemy Jug for acid. Eventually they led us the entrance of the cave the trolls are hiding in.

At the first troll, Derwood landed 3 arrows, two critical and combined with the arrows did a record 68 damage.
<hr>
After we slayed the trolls, we slipped out of the cave when hobgoblins and goblins showed up and started smoking out the cave. We camped out on the hill until dawn when we ambushed the hobgoblins.

The Kara Jhinzkha let us know these goblins come from Var-Galaria from the western Etruria. Var-galaria is a Imperial Union. Hob-goblin empire quite far from Lothal but considered existential threat to continental nations. Var-galaria is technologically advanced, their armies are disciplined and organized.
The Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha) tell us there a lot of more hob-goblins approaching from the western coasts. They assimilate native goblinoids. It's possible the goblins were starting negotiations with trolls.   
Barta says the western shores are more than 10-30 days ride to the western coast and that's including circumnavigating the great Lake Kharnar.
The Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha) clans are meeting at S’uubaa’neetai (Suubaaneetai) in the Kuskwharuum Basin.
This party is assigned to slay monsters that descend from the snowing mountain pass.
Tribes Meriket, Kipchak, Ulaanbator, Tseng-Ta, Kyrghaz.
The sage is Tjin Yesun.
Monters and demons smashed through Tumen-ord and forced the Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha) forced these people to be migratory. Chief Malkus Yellow-arrow wants us to be mobile but push back north where they had been driven out.
Firefist denounced the traditions of Kara-Jhinzkha (KaraJhinzkha) and split off.

## 14 of Marpenoth
Arrival at S'uubaa'neetai (Suubaaneetai), a vast collection of yurts, tents and huts. Leather tents colors denote tribes. There are many pastures and penned mammals. We estimate five thousand people reside here.

We will meet Malkus Yellow-arrow tomorrow.
<hr>
There are all manner of animals. Most familial yurts have their own pens for animals. This area is also good for protecting the river crossing. Barta and his band the outriders keep the demons away from the river by any means. In the spring they move to the south west to feed better. The town is a mix of races but aren't any dwarves or elves.
Barta and the outriders were tasked with this by Chief Yellow-arrow.
The clans revere the elderly where they lead the family units.

## 15th of Marpenoth
In the morning Barta tours us around the camp before taking us to the Amber throne

The tribes of the clan:

### Maraket
Maraket camp sold tool the camel. Their camp is outside the rest because the camels scare the other horses. The camels are prized for their long distance abilities.
The fighters fight with crossbows and melee as well as a camel based artillery.
Their leader is Torgan the human and is friendly. The clan is very loyal.

### Kipchak
Decorate their tents in indigo and blues with broken arrow symbology. Kipchak traditionally lived north of the st. reese. Their leader is Dogtar, a human male, he is younger and quick to anger. Could be sympathetic to the near-yeet.
Dogtar will occasionally lead attacks against neutral tribes. He is always pushing to recapture the lands to the north.   

### Ulaanbator
Dress and display in earth-tones. They are from lake Kharnar area. The largest tribe in the clan. They propbably would have flourished in Neiryeet but the Silugukhan half-human half hobgoblin chief is fanatically loyal to Yellow-arrow. Silugukhan is Barta's grandson.
They are good with plants and animals.

### Tseng-Ta
Head of a stag symbology. Especially violent history. Decades of fierce fighting with the orcs of star-fjord to the south.
Only recently arrived here summer of last year.
Mahamu is their leader with a scarlet veil. They practice secret-ish blood rituals before battle.  
Mahamu is quite loyal and doesn't argue very much with yellow-arrow.

### Kyrghaz
Skilled horse archers. Most famous trait is reindeer lancers. Their symbol is the silver mountain that is on our newly purchased armor.  
Solongo the human male is their leader and goes way back with yellow-arrow. Solongo has been in the clan the longest.   



Chief Malkus Yellow-arrow
5 and 0/2 feet tall. Dressed in furs with a red pointed hat. Half-halfling and half-orc. She has bowed legs likely from riding. She is seated on the amber throne, an actual single piece of amber.
There is an old looking hairless half-orc with dark green skin. Tjinyesun.
There are columns that support the center of the yurt of gilded reeds along with steel and iron armor. The colors are primary yellow, orange and red.
Tool offers Al Capony as a gift to Yellow-arrows.
Malkus offers us a feast of mostly meat and dairy. Maslin is seated with the other chiefs. Koomis the fermeted milk is served.
We discussed Aleuwyn and Malkus lets us know that his mosters mostly arrive during the dead of winter. Re-animated dead men and monster. Also great Blue Wyrms.   

Malkus doesn't fight in the wastes. Their avoid conflict when possible including luring the beasts away from the river. She considers standing and fighting as a last resort.
Tumen Ord was a great fortress.  
Tjinyesun, the half-orc sage. Ctemoria was a city.

The split between the KJ and Firefist happened after a close election which Yellow-arrow won. Firefist wanted to re-take their old fortress and re-settle the lands. Firefist is a murdering heretic according to Malkus.  

Tjinyesun doesn't know what lies in the wastes. Rumor has it, there is a stone fortress in the sky. This aligns with vision of Elisha's.

Malkus honors their ancestors and Sumigone the hunter by not settling down. There cannot be peace between the two clans while both Malkus and Firefist live. Malkus considers trading with Firefist an act of war.   

At the conclusion of the dinner, Malkus gives each of us a gold-plated tables showing a wolf and a moose charing together. These will indicate our friendship with Malkus.

Tjinyesun advises against going to the wastes because it is really really cold.   


## 16th - 22nd of Marpenoth
After a day of rest, we left for Tumen Ord. A few days later we arrived at the approaches of Tumen Ord. We followed directions from Chimbai.

## 22nd of Marpenoth
The fortress is formidable and at the end of a narrow path up a mountain side. There are turrets with catapults and everything is covered in a dark red paint. A large keep dominates the structure and is topped with a glowing rippling orb.
<hr>
The entrance of the fortress has two 30' turrets mounted with catapults, near the entrance. Blood is painted down the sides of the outer walls. A few groups of villages are waiting in line outside the gates. A few bodies are impaled on pikes on the bridge. The bodies are orcs but two of the human bodies are Chimbai and Okin.
The guards are checking the villagers papers before entry. Villagers without papers are arrested. We pleaded diplomatic privilege for entry.
Upon entry they confiscate all of our magical items and weapons and escort us to the palace. We spotted a few priests wearing large white robes and necklaces with orbs. The soldiers are referred to as keshigs.    
The palace is the 150' tall Crimson Palace of the Eternal Sun.
The orb isn't magical but just carved intricately. The guards symbol is a fist in a sun. The main hall is very impressive. The city here seems a little overcrowded and hovels hug the walls. Var-galarian architecture.
There are four large statues in a fountain with constantly flowing alcohol liquids.

We are kept waiting for a few hours before Skied Firefist Neiryeet arrives. Several slaves haul in a throne made of bones, stone and iron.  
Firefist is a tall green-skinned half-orc with tinges of red and orange near where his veins. Dark red hair and eyes. Dressed in a fur half-tunic. Total beef-castle. He wears an antler crown.  
The Tumen-orc is not impressed with us. He wants us to fight at a festival honoring gock-teska tomorrow. We will be fighting five of Firefists champion at the circle of blood. We will be staying overnight at the Gilded Gauntlet.   
The inn which is near the palace, is quiet but very nicely appointed. We are allocated a fine suite.
The fight turned out to be a lively game of capture the flag. After we starting winning the fight, Firefist entered the field and attacked us.
<hr>
He invited us to a party and we were sent back to our rooms to pack our bags. Instead of a group of tribes, there are just the Neiryet and a family the Shen.
We went the well-kempt Choi Ba-ataal Market. The market even includes foreign traders from other clans. There are a few orcs from star-fjord. We also checked out the slaves for sale. They also are willing to buy slaves.
Another vendor is selling The flying mantas for 250gp each. Kristif and I purchased one each. I learned that the tugriks can be converted for 5 marks for 1 gold and we converted all of our paper currency into gold.  
We also visisted the Crook and Spear, a bar in a working class section of town. The proprietor is a human man named Ajir. After buying a round of drinks for the house, a server offered "private services" to Tool.
Eventually we made our way to the party. Right as we were about to let our guard down and start to enjoy ourselves, Marlowe gathered us around and told us Margareta commanded her to kill a solar priestess, Oghul Qatun and steal a fancy scepter. This solar-priestess convinced Firefist to move to this place. The scepter is the Scepter of the Eternal Sun.
Remember that Marlowe and Maslin have my Eagle's Splendor.
<hr>
We took our rest and Kristif sent a message to Margareta to clarify her command.

## 23rd of Marpenoth
We were gently heard-ed out the town. We decided to make a stealth camp out of sight with the intent of sneaking back inside.
That night we executed our plan, we cast all of our concealment spells and Maslin gave us the ability to fly. Marlowe and I floated in the palace and down the stairs toward the vault. The vault door has a blindfolded Solar holding a topaz orb carved onto it. Marlowe gave the door the name and a trinket and it opened. After a few puzzles we retrieved the scepter and slipped out unnoticed. Maslin's fly spell had worn off by the time we needed to leave, so ex-fil was more challenging than we expected.

## 24th of Marpenoth
After meeting back up at our discrete camp, we began the trek back to Camp Crystal lake. I used a scroll of identify on the scepter.

## 24th of Marpenoth to of 3rd Uktar
Traveling back to camp. We fought a flying wendigo and its summons. My storm ray, Ray Bradbury, had got hurt a little. They haven't seen us since the 10th of Marpenoth.

## 4rd of Uktar to 20th of Uktar
We traveled back to ice-end. I fell off Ray Bradbury. The whole route was fraught with calamities.
<hr>

## 20th of Uktar
At town we sold all of the metal and most of the magicite from camp crystal lake.
We met with Harbeck. For once, he's glad to see us because he's nervous about the solstice on the 20th of Nightal. The Rookrustle Kenku have gone missing.

## 20th of Uktar - 20th of Nigthal
Marlowe and I spent these weeks training in nature and stealth.

## 20th of Nightal, the winter solstice
There will be almost no daylight. The winds are pretty strong this morning. Rikki, Preston and Margareta gave me their consolation before heading to shelter.
As the sun falls, an enormous Aurora spread out over the town. A projected larger image of Aleuwyn appears above the town and tells us he's sorry we have chosen to die.
We faced off against a crowd of coldlight walkers, shadows and ice-mephits accompanied by giant angry snowball with too many eyes. We slayed them and the aurora dimmed for a bit.
The next wave arrived with a rumbling through the ground.
<hr>
- Check if Aleuwyn is still levitating
Aleuwyn cast time-stop.
Marlowe slew Aleuwyn with a sustained sunbeam. His spirit retreated to the northwest? From his body comes a shade of a woman. She is dressed in a long moss colored robe and a silver circlet. She is the mother of Aleuwyn and tells us that we only killed a clone of himself. He will attack again next solstice. She is Aleuwyn's memory of the perception of his mother Queen Creiddylad. Aleuwyn is the last Court Eternal of Gwynnyfryd and an Eladrin. Eladrin are similar to elves but older.
He lives in their last bastion, Methyr Tynylhoff in the northern wasteland. He is weakest at the summer solstice. They had been Eladrin of the Summer a long a time ago.
Aleuwyn failed to cast Soul-bomb to protect the Eladrin.

Later we were called into Harbeck's office with Lady Cliffsend. She paid us   
- 19,000gp
- 1,900pp
- 9x 500gp gems (1x Alexandrite, 2x Aquamarine, 4x Black Pearl, 1x Blue Spinel, 1x Peridot)
- Absorption Ioun Stone
Whistia also gave us each a nice handkerchief.

## 20th of Nightal - 30th of Nightal
Stealth for nature training

## 30th of Hammer 1062
We threw a party for the town. Kristif and I provided free Blacksun-Yarn brews for the town. Rikki and I once again attempted to set up Tool and Janreth to no avail.

## 1st of Hammer 1062 - 21st of Hammer
Completing Nature and Stealth training
We plan to investigate the Rookrustle and then complete Marlowe's fortress at the Temple of the Set Sun.
<hr>

## 21st - 23rd of Hammer
Travelling to rookrustle by flying ray.

## 23rd of Hammer
We arrive in rookrustle.  Blackblade greets us and syas they are glad to see us. Wormbelly and Storymaster and several villages have gone into the sanctuary A few weeks ago on the solstice. They are cut off from their hive-mind connection to eachother.
She said it was time for the people "forfill their duty to meet the foremind". This breaks with every tradition. She called on everyone to go but some of us did not want to.
Storymaster also brought tools of war into the sanctum.
Blackblade is glad that we are here and willing to investigate the sanctum.
The foremind is what created the Rookrustle and gave them the hive mind properties.
50 of the 300 kenku went into the santum. The remaining Kenku are having hard time without the mental connections.
Storymaster's behavior had been acting more strange after the battle at Keswick Canyon where our faces fought together. After that she was more resolute on serving the foremind. She had a stronger desire to get closer the foremind.
Blackblade says they don't know how to train a new leader so they are looking to just get storymaster back.
Bubblemaker is having trouble suppressing her dread.  

Blackblade takes us to an wooden elevator to lower us down the into the pit safely. In the center of the pit is the sancutary, a small square building. The pit walls are 200ft.
The walls are sheer and not hewn resembling a canyon. Blackblade takes us to the building. A waterfall leads a small stream into another pit. This time of year, the waterfall is mostly frozen.
The structure is the center of the pit and made out of steel resembling bunker. It has sloped walls and has a defensive architecture. There is a large double door on one side of it.
The door has a basin attached to the front. Marlowe put one of her collected brains in the basin and it opened the door.

Once the door lowered into the ground, Wormbelly was on the other side of the door. She is unhappy to see us. I noticed that this is a magical projection of her. She is referring to herself in the singular instead of plural as before. She does not want us to enter the sanctum. She is working with Storymaster to fulfill a role that the Storymaster keeps. Our actions which created the flying spirit which sent her into the sanctum, are representing of the power imbalance we created. She says that there is no way for the surface kenku to have their own mind network separate from the bunker kenku. The foremind was the one who created their hive mind powers.    
I heard a grinding noise in the bunker. Inside we are on a metal balcony above a platform, but a set of stairs have been retracted. The lower platforms have kenku brandishing weapons.      
Maslin's lightning bolt boosted a giant metallic scorpion's own lightning. Marlowe was wounded by concentrated volley of arrows. The metal-scorpion tank is resistant to a fireball. It struggles with dexterity. It was destroyed by acid and ice. We suspect it is resistant to necrotic damage as well.

Nicolo joins us after the fight. He reported on the cavern underneath the waterfalls second pit. It descends 250-300  feet and probably connects to other caves    

On the ground floor, after the fight, there are two passages, a wider and narrower. Down the wider passage I heard another grinding sound. We headed down the narrower passage, which started to descend down and leads to another spiral staircase going down another 50 feet. The hallways are similar to those of Steeltooth's lair but more kept up. We met another steel door. We are around 95ft down.   
I could hear a faint humming noise on the other side of the door. Nicolo slipped in the door as a spider and opened it from the other side.

<hr>

The door opened into a massive room with 80ft room with a large nautilus shaped metallic object in the room. One of the walls of this room is different from the others. It looks like it might drop down.

Including the tendrils this ship is 180ft long, without 90ft. 70ft height. There are stairs leading up to a door, which is ajar and armed kenku are peeking out. The ship appears organic in origin, augmented with metal parts.

On the floor is a bubbling pool near the tendrils where we can also hear whispering. The pool is feed by drops from the tendrils.

Having boarded the ship, red glowing suits of armor are approaching. The Helmed horror is resistant to piercing and force damage.

We captured a kenku named Jangler. Maslin put him under a Gease and we interrogated him. He said Wormbelly is going to use the energy in the Nautiloid to open a portal to communicate with the foremind. Storymaker/Wormbelly is somewhere in the hole in the ceiling.  

The Nautiloid is metallic and organic on the inside as well. We severed the cables it had connected through a hole in the ceiling. There is an energy source in the lower deck of the ship. We recovered 4 mindblades from the ship and 2 canisters for the flame hose on the prow of the ship. The helmed horrors both yield suits of plate armor. There are also artillery shells.

The hole in the ceiling is around 60 feet long. The old1600 Storymaster is dead.

We climbed up the chains coming from ship, and entered a room with a growing portal. We fought and killed Wormbelly/Storymaker. Aleuwyn's defeat weakened the barrier to planar travel. After Wormbelly's defeat the remaining three Kenku surrendered.

<hr>

Blackblade and Bubblemaker request to live near ice-end. We proposed that they live across the river. They agreed as they wanted to leave Rookrustle. We exiled Djangler who had been under a Gease of Maslin's who traveled North.   

## 24th of Hammer
Resting.

## 24th - 26th of Hammer
Safe return to ice-end.  

## 26th of Hammer to 16th of Alturiak
Trading nature for stealth skills with Marlowe.   
One night we were all at Mordecai's. The Briggs Brothers are arguing over who is buying Whistia Knight a drink. We talked to a few townsfolk.   
We may have convinced the Briggs Brothers to stop bickering.

## 16th of Alturiak
Kristif's temple was completed. It is a stone temple built into the side of the cliff.  

## 17th of Alturiak
Spent the day casting plant growth on the town's fields. Captain Pybba decides to join Kristif's church. I had a great conversation with Calvin about his marriage.  
Drusilla is concerned about something coming down through the pass. A big metal thing covered with bodies and a basket of bones is heading to Kristif's new temple.  
The undead collector and specters are resistant to piercing damage. Kristif slew it with an enormous holy lightning strike.   

<hr>

## Blurnsday, 22nd of Alturiak
Mordecai invites us to a night of cards and drinks in his suite underneath whitemoon threads.
The chef dwarf opens up a trapdoor by stamping by on a pressure plate on the floor. In the chamber is Mordecai's personal office. The there is a smokey red haze around the room. There is actual red velvet on the walls.
He makes us drinks and plays cards with us for an hour. We get the impression he has an agenda. There are a few magical items.
Mordecai wants us to be discrete about a business proposal. He would like to purchase an exclusive contract for future magicite we collect. He doesn't want us to renege on the contract with the Boundless Odyssey Trading Company.
It could be awkward with the BOTC but not illegal.
From his new shipment, I bought a potion of good of hope for 660gp.
We bought three training books nature, arcana and history.


## The month of Alturiak
We  met a bunch of new people.
- The Communicants of Light, inquisitors of the church of Apollo.
-- They arrive in a chartered ship during while the coast still had a good amount of ice. The ship drops them off and the leaves.
-- There are three of them.
-- Inquisitor Suprema, a tall, wiry Dragonborn. Dark priestly robes. Scaly bronze skin. Professional with an air of superiority.  
-- A half-elf woman, a paladin knight. Lieutenant to Suprema. Shorter but muscled. Clearly tired but attempting to hide it. Evil almond colored eyes. Blue cloak.
-- Papa-ardelle human knight-paladin. A big, older portly guy. Sunny and amiable.
- Hazel Knot-wrench, a traveling bard
- The Green Moss Society, a druidic order.
-- Led by a older human woman . Curled cropped auburn hair and sun-crisped reddish-brown skin. She is missing her right foot and seems a bit frail. Dressed in stripped robes, red yellow, black.
-- A halfling Begga Puddlehand, the most junior member of the party. Cyan eyes and rugged skin. Thin and frail. Plain brown coat. Cheery and chaotic.
-- Young half-elf man, Abrama Locke, wild ruggedly handsome look. Light skin which is not as weathered. Have small scars on ankles. Quiet and reserved. Accompanied by a wolf, Akira.
- Servants of the Sundered Moon, another adventuring party.
- Godfrey Roundtree, a baron


We first me the inquisitors with Harbeck who recognizes Papa. They embrace as if they are old friends. They settle in a house as if they are here for the long haul.


We also meet the Green Moss Society, a druidic order from a general colonist ship. They are here to watch out for Oxfrills. Abrahma Akira is his brother, he accompanies him. We set up a play date with Preston. He's down to share a J. Getting to know him a bit better, he's been in the green moss society mostly his whole life. He was found in the woods and doesn't know who his parents. Akira is basically his adoptive brother. The Green Moss Society comes from unincorporated forests south of the free cities.    
He says they are here to do right by nature and make sure there is a good balance.    

<hr>

## 2nd of Ches
In the evening, Marlowe was approached by Patsy. Pasty seems concerned about the Inquisitors. The inquisitors we asking about the nature of the services Calvin and Marlowe. Pasty says the locals are on Marlowe's side.

The rest of us were approached by a representative of Lady Cliffsend and brings us to Harbeck's place. Lady Cliffsend explains why we are here without Marlowe. She tells us the inquisition may be trouble for Marlowe. It is illegal for her to inform Marlowe.  
We know that the church has authority to prosecute religious crimes with some flexibility. Maslin spreads the word at Mordecai's about Marlowe's good deeds.  

Kristif talked to Marlowe about what Cliffsend said.

## 3rd of Ches

The three inquisitors approached Marlowe to ask questions. Papa-ardelle, Inquisitor Suprema, and Seraphina. They are armed and armored. They inquisted Marlowe under a Zone of Truth.

<hr>

The inquisition is satisfied and are working on undoing the charming on Calvin which had made him forget about Margareta. They ward the Wodehouse family. Margareta pretends as if Calvin is her dad.

## 22nd of Ches

Baron Roundtree promises authority and his knights to meet us at Crystal lake.

Marlowe is heading out to The temple of the set sun. The rest of us head to Algana.

## 25th of Ches

Arrival at Algana. Greeted by Greyvill and Jotah. The members of the tribe are welcoming and willing to fight with us. Our trading has allowed them to incorporate metal tools.
Greyvill will lead the warriors to Camp Crytal Lake, with dog sleds.

Greyvill + Patsy


## 1-10th of Tarsakh

Arrival at The Temple of the Setting Sun.
We christened `Margareta and Marlowe's Magnificent Midsummer Mansion`.
We took a day trip to Fort Ten Candles. The fort is in disrepair. The forest still shows signs of clear cutting.

We considered re-occupying FTT.

We re-named the tributary to the unnamed river the Sun-Stream.

We found no-one at the creepy ashy village. The ashy demarcation is starting to be reclaimed by nature.

We also found a pass towards a special cave.

## 11of Tarsakh - 21st Mirtul

Kristif spent the week fishing and smoking fish.

Maslin spent the month making herbal potions.

Options
Surgeon's tools to gather monster bits.

Long rest? I spent the time growing plants, spying, and collecting monster bits. Collecting more mistletoe for goodberries.

1 week finding plenty of mistletoe. 3 weeks of gardening around the Midsummer Mansion.

## 21st - 29 of Mirtul

Travel to and arrival at Subinity.
We arrived on a day of battle between the Maraket tribe and Neiryeet.

We defeated the Neiryeet and left no humanoid witnesses. Afterwards we talked with the leader of the clan, Torgan who is grateful for our efforts. The Neiryeet have been attacking regularly which is unusual for this far south. Torgan thinks there may have been trouble in the north. The raids have also been coming from the woods. There is also a sacred burial site in those woods.

The site and the guardian spirit are on a mound in the middle of the woods. We decided to venture in an fight the spirit.

In the forest I spotted tracks of heavy humanoids and horses. The trees told me the heavy humanoids were talking about burning the forest down. We followed the heavy humanoid tracks.

We crept up on a group of ten hobgoblin of Var Galaria. They want to torch the trees but they want to wait until the riders.

<hr>

Now we are heading back toward the path of the Nieryet. We found them fighting with humanoids possessed by roots and thorns. One of the plants has a humanoid shape but isn't made from a dead body.

We burned and shot the plantiods to death.

We made our way to the burial mound surrounded by some pools.
A spirit is waving its hands over a stone slab. He says "I've been watching you". The forest spirit is mad at the Maraket for wanting the forest to be contained. The spirit thinks that the Maraket are trying to use the forest as a resource.

A gigantic frog attacked us as well! We had a tough fight but won. Though I was poisoned and protracted a bad fever.

<hr>

Tomorrow Kristif can remove the necrotic poison.

Torgan is deeply thankful for our actions. They will be able to start making magical arrows. He gifts us two items of The Maraket Family Blade, Bell of Trap Finding, and Bracers of Life Stealing. We didn't take the blade.


## 4th of Kythorn
Arrival at Suubaaneetai.

We presented ourselves to Chief Yellow-Arrow on her impressive throne. This time there are fewer accommodations. Yellow-Arrow has a fresh scar. The tribes are called the KaraJhinzkha. They have been raided frequently by hobgoblins and Neiryet who are working together now.

The Nieryet and hobgoblins have combined armor across the river. If defeated, Yellow-Arrow can give spare some forces for us.  

With us having defeated them in open battle, there were a just enough casualties to the combined Neiryet and Hobgoblin forces for cause them retreat.


While travelling, one night a human woman wanders in, Velatra Whisperwind. Caster in appearance, but with bow as well. She has come in pursuit of a person who has gone in the same direction we are traveling.

She is hunting the lich leader, Kuva the Whispered-one, a leader of a slavery ring that Velatra has broken up. She thinks the wastes will protect and increase his power. She is skilled in tracking and hunting. Kuva would not fight with Aleuwyn. She is not asking for our assistance. Kuva's ring had been in the Free-cities. She agrees that defeating Aleuwyn would serve her.

Her words seem genuine but rehearsed. She agreed to let us search her possessions. Drusilla is a little concerned with her stealth since Drusilla didn't see her coming.

Her possessions are as expected. Janreth does not recognize the Lich or Velatra. We will allow her to join us.


## 4th - 15th Kythorn
Travelling is very difficult, it is basically constant blizzard.

<hr>

It's very cold and we don't like it. Continually dark too. The dread is creeping in. After a series of misfortunes, we discovered ruins to take shelter in. Getting closer, the ruins look like that of buildings, Mostly buried in under the snow. Big metal spikes are poking up out of the ground. The metal bits do resemble the structure of a Nautiloid cruiser. The forging matches our mind-blades.

The snow is built up on the destroyed buildings. As we investigated the buildings, we heard a howling on the wind. More like a great moaning of great remorse. It appears and looks like a storm with a face.

We informed the armies why were are here. The Algonans asked if it was Aleuwyn who caused the "Downheaval". Where ground fell out of the sky, and then Etruria was discovered. The Algonans said that they used to live on a series of islands, but here. Only Algona has a flood myth.

Velatra also listened. She had heard that teleportation and planar travel doesn't happen here. She asks if Aleuwyn is the cause of that. We suspect that Aleuwyn could indeed have been the cause.

On our way, we felt like we were approaching the eye of the storm. The weather is very likely artificial and not following a natural pattern.

We entered a clearing with a clearer sky.

There are shimmering aurora in the sky. There is a massive mountain-sized dead tree. It reaches up to the sky. It is a faded gold color. Cascading down the tree are flows of ice.

There are many smaller trees with buildings built into them. It looks like the icicles have their own sculpted appearance.

We talked to Janreth who confirms that Velatra came alone. Janreth has not heard of Velatra or the lich. Janreth isn't sure of her motivations.

We investigated Velatra a bit more. Kristif detected magic and found that Velatra is encased in illusion magic.

Marlow intimidated Velatra into having her remove her ring which hiding her true elvish appearance. Her skin is weathered and she is carrying a bow. She looks weary and like she has been through a lot. Her name is Taaveti. She admits the lich was made up she wants to capture Aleuwyn alive.

She wants to keep the blocks on inter-planar travel and if that means keeping Aleuwyn alive, that's what she'll fight for.

## 16th of Kythorn

We rested up to prepare for infiltration tomorrow. At night the big tree was twinkling and the icicles were actually molten glass of magicite. The pulses with the pulses of dread.

<hr>

## 17th of Kythorn

As we and our gathered forces emerged from the blizzard and started marching toward the immense tree, we passed many deserted buildings resembling trees. Many are burnt or destroyed. Shattered Nautiloid vessels are scattered around as well.

The main source of light is coming from the Aurora on the top of the tree. The aurora started pulsing when we arrived and is still pulsing at the same rate. Maslin suspects the magic in the magicite is being drawn somewhere.

With us is Elisha, Patchy, Drusilla and Taaveti, but it seems like Taaveti will be resistant to receiving orders.

Getting closer to the tree, it is humongous. We passed through a portcullis into a battlefield with many snow-golems and Remorhaz. An Illusory Aleuwyn appears and taunts us but we won't turn around.

Arrows not so effective against Remorhaz armor.

Silver arrows were effective against Aleuwyn's ball of protection.

We defeated his armies in the field and defeated his simulacrum. I was feebleminded

<hr>

Aftermath of the battle: our forces are gathered up around the tree, preparing for attack/siege. The lowest branches are 60ft up. Some of the branches have wrapped themselves around eachother forming a cage up in the tree.

Taaveti gives each of a us a piece of magic jerky. When torn apart, creates a hero's feast of long rest.

The is a portculis keeping us out of the tree. Two stone golems are holding the portculis in place. One golem is  crumbling. The other golem is probably intact. We took the heart of the crumbled golem.

Maslin firebolted some of the ice in front of the gate. The golems are stone. It awoke and started at us so we killed it.

All of us working together were able to lift the portculis. As we came through, two large chariots started flying towards us. Behind the chariots are ice-elemental who may have thrown the chariots. Mechanical archers approach come out onto the balconies to shoot at us.

I fired a lot of arrows invisibly from a rope trick. Necrotic damage worked against Aleuwyn. Aleuwyn fled.

Aleuwyn cast prismatic wall which we were not able to cross. The wall disappeared after 10 minutes.

The drones are shorter versions of elves. Their bodies are mostly stone but with metal too. Their faces are expressionless though. They are built in servants clothes. Magically powered but no magicite.

Through one trapped door is an old inn. Through another door is a ruined giant conservatory. There are holes in the ceiling and craters in the floor. Half destroyed husks of scorpion-tanks and a mechanical boar that breathed fire at one point. Another metal carcass of a giant octopus. Frozen skeletons and bits of magicite litter the room.

The skeletons are elven akin but there are are no extra rows of teeth. They don't show signs of ever have have grown. They are slightly taller.

On some of the walls are small bots for bonsai trees. There are few weapon racks with inert automata. Another guard room has a nice spear. The shaft is very dark brown and the spearhead is sharp steel with streaks of blue. It is a mage- banes spear.

I talked to the one remaining bonsai. It said all the other invaders were killed by the master. Many elves died in the invasion but the rest died as collateral. The bonsai is very nice and gave me a mini pomegranate. Remember to take this bonsai, Pommy, on the way home. The invaders were mindflayers. Another door where Aleuwyn went in to is locked.

We explored the upstairs hallways. There is a planetarium and a statuary of all elven figures. Similar to those in the library and Oladon's tomb. Greenish robes and painted in vibrant clothes. Each statue has a hand out towards the view holding a sphere. Each globe is warm colored with some red.

Touching an orb, shows a video on the ceiling showing these elves performing magnificent works of metal, capentry and molding wood by their hands in seconds. We see them crafting the automata. We start to feel memories in the back of our minds. They called this Methyr Tynylhoff, Arborea. The court eternal of Gwynnyfryd. The elves are called Eladrin and they came from all over Methyr Tynylhoff to study and work here. Gwynnyfryd had only one son Aleuwyn.

We find another gallery displaying art. Mystical represents of the place Arborea held in the cosmos/planes. Arborea can be depicted as a floating island with a tree reaching into the sky. There may be other parts of the feywild here too. Lots of art.

Patsy breaks down a door into a foyer over the portculis. Three more statues of Gwynnyfryd, Aleuwyn and Queen Creiddylad.

I found a panel that slides into the wall and looks leads to a shaft. Nicolo investigated the shaft and found the sound of water moving through a big pipe. He reports also that the tunnel comes into a shaft where water is moving up.

We then followed the stairs down from the foyer to another room with a large set of levers. More royal statues that are shattered and broken. Beyond is a large market style plaza. Neat buildings here is burnt to hell by mindflayer machines.

<hr>

Down the stairs we came to a magically locked door. Taaveti worked on the door but that activated the three statues which attacked us.

After defeating the statues which had downed Patsy, we entered the doorway into a very high-ceiling room of a marketplace. Spectral Eladrin perform daily life in the market. Aleuwyn in the corner asks us if we like the view of the past of this place.

Maslin implored him not to fight. He can't allow us to keep our place here. Does he know that we are not in Arborea any more? He says the whole continent was brought from Arborea.

He performed powerful forbidden magic to defeat the mindflayers, against his father's advice. He drew on the essence of all of the citizens of Methyr Tynylhoff. All creatures were killed including the mindflayers. The spell pushed us to this plane.

Magicite is the essence of the dead Eladrin. They had no travelers because the Eladrin lived forever.

The specters then attacked us claiming we were the invaders. I shot and destroyed Aleuwyn right away but the specters remained. Marlowe tried to convince them to stop attacking us by changing her appearance to that of an Eladrin.

<hr>

We searched the place and found some cool bits.

Some doors look like they have been used by heavy hands.

We found an automated kitchen.

There is a dumbwaiter that leads down to a storeroom.

Downstairs there was a earthen tunnel connected to the tree.

Also beyond the kitchen are a nother room full of automata. A bar, fancy plates and tables. Lots of open floor space. Attached are private meditation rooms. We took the guest book.

There is an outline in the dust of a missing large automata.

In another room off the market, we saw some tiles roped off next to a stairway going down. We went down and found 4 magical pilars holding up (?) the tiles. We played around with them for a while.

We fought nine automata and a dragon. Automata were could take with thunder damage. The dragon hid around a corner and we killed it in the basement.

We ate our jerky after the fight and a Hero's Feast.

<hr>

There was a guard station next to the outer wall of the circle around the inner tree. There are three levers: Automata, teleportation Circle, Capillary Route. They are up up down.

    _____
   / ___ \
 _/ /   \ \
|GR |   | |
  \ \___/ /
   \_____/


We turned the automata switch down and the Capillary Route up. The Capillary Route activated a whooshing sound in the core of the donut. Sounds like water going up.

We found three magically items: A longbow, leather pouldrons, light armor. We Identified them as Astrisroot Bow, Gambeson of the Mossy Grove, Snowpath Pauldron. I took the Bow.

I found two secret doors. One leading into the core, one leading out of the outside ring. Neither is locked. The outside door opens into a large room, with a big circle etched into the ground. We turned the teleportation circle lever back on, but the circle is damaged and probably doesn't work.

Maslin quickly restored the circle which is a bigger version of the spell Teleportation Circle. But it isn't able to be activated; it is being blocked.

The circle may have been like a transit hub.

The inner door leads to water running upward. Maslin stuck his head in and could breath and didn't get wet. Flipping the Capillary Route lever switches the direction the water is going to down.

We turned it up, and then jumped into the capillary "elevator". We came out in a landing area in an open air throne room.

The Throne is empty. There is a large courtyard with large piles of magicite and littler trees growing from the big tree.

Aleuwyn is at the far edge of the courtyard performing some ritual on the storm. Aleuwyn is pulling energy out of the piles of magicite one at a time.

As he was dying, Aleuwyn asked us to remember his people. Aleuwyn killed Oladon. Oladon was turned a mindflayer. Taaveti failed to stabilized him but says that his body could be of use.

We looted the castle.

We debated how much gold to give to Roundtree.

<hr>

Do we still have the Scepter of the Eternal sun? for the common fund. Yes

DM said we would probably get enough xp to get to level 12
- [ ] Combat: Dispell wall from Marlowe, storm on a storm for Kristif, Kristif's mass cure wounds, slaying Aleuwyn
- [ ] Rollplay: Vicious mockery from Kristif "As sorry as you were for your people"


Taaveti wanted to raise Aleuwyn so she put him in a mirror in the bag of the holding. We don't want him to be raised. She wants to experiments on his body.

The storm is breaking and the snow is melting.

We also debated with Roundtree for how much of the spoils he would get. He had fought snow golems and ice elementals during the battle. His men are starting to loot minor objects. He was satisfied with 4 of the black sapphires worth 5000gp each.  

Most of the groups we took with us are eager to go home.

The KaraJhinzkha is elated that they now don't have to deal with these monsters.

We are heading home with the group on horses. Navigation is easy now that we are going out of valley.

We took Pommy with us as we began the journey. Our first destination is Suubaaneetai.

On our way out we spotted a lot of wreckage: leveled ruins of villages of Arborea, burnt grown-wood houses, mindflayer war machinery. Also the immediacey of the effect of Aleuwyn's magic becomes apparent.

We speculated about why there were magicite in the mines. Perhaps there was a concentration of Eladrin there. It doesn't seem like the mindflayers were turned into magicite. Perhaps the magicite in the mindflayer mines were under the control of the mindflayers.

Taaveti invites us to the Owlbear. Drusilla is appreciative.

We are welcomed to Suubaaneetai where there is a feast in our honor. The Algonans joined us, where this is a watershed moment for them.

When we were a few days away from Camp Crystal Lake we got a sense of wrongness. Then we saw several large creatures teleported onto a hill in front of them. Cadaver Collectors. They are giant metal humanoids with bodies speared onto them. We see that the collectors are standing at attention.

A human in robes stands between them like they respond to him. His clothes are nice but he looks like he has stopped keeping himself up. Instead of walking, he levitates on a mass of roiling bones.

He says he is Bant and looking for Taaveti. He is angry to not have found Taaveti. He wants it related to the end of entropy. He leaves us with a skull to use to communicate. He teleports away with his Cadaver Collectors.

Camp Crystal Lake is in the same state as when we left it.

We made it back to Ice End safely.

<hr>

## 5th of Flamerule

There is going to be a festival about our return and defeat of Aleuwyn. The Algonans are sticking around. They are appreciative. There is a victory parade through town. Drinking and feasting. It is a basic military parade.

We make sure Drusilla and Patsy get attention. Honoring.

We will make the Summer Solstice a new holiday in ice-end. "The Great Thaw".

Maslin wants to gate studying the Methyr Tynylhoff behind teaching teaching at his new academy. Will recruit in Lothal.

The feasting is a little restrained. Lady Cliffsend praises our valor and prowess. Statues will be made for the four of us and those that helped. Lady Cliffsend offers favors and assistance.

Maslin made a speech as well emphasizing peace.

Thaddeus seems like he is interested in building a teleportation circle very urgently and visiting the ruins of Methyr Tynylhoff.

Calvin, Margareta and Nicolo are there. Margareta is congratulatory to us that Aleuwyn is dead. Margereta is keeping away from Calvin. Margareta lives with Calvin but she acts differently than with us. She is playing the part of being Calvin's daughter.

Mrs. Thorpe asks how we are doing? We are homesick and exhausted from travel and battle. She was concerned about us.

Tenario is partying it up with the common folk. He's riding the high of the celebration. He's happy that the town is developing. His god, Aristle is of Civilization and we are 'civilizing' the area.

Dorian is working with Harbeck as a steward. Kristif wants to recruit him.  

Maslin embellishes the tale of what we did to Hazel Knotwrench. Maslin wants our names to ring out into Lothal. Kristif drunkenly attempts to help.

The kenku and Blackblade do attend but don't get into as much of the revelry. They are making progress reconstructing the village. Blackblade tells us that the Kenku are running into financial trouble. Needs 3000gp to complete. Another 2000gp gets fortificaiton and weapons training. Maslin paid for it out of pocket.

I ordered a temple for 8000gp - 10% for building off what Maslin started so 7200gp. The temple will take 100 days to construct and will be complete on the 15th of Marpenoth. The temple takes the form of a forest preserve.

<hr>

I remembered I bought 40x +2 arrows and +2 studded leather armor for 1000gp and 6000gp. I gave my old +1 studded leather armor to Drusilla.

## 5th of Flamerule to 15th of Marpenoth

I spotted a 5.5ft tall praying-mantis walking towards the market square. It's got a few rucksacks and a large feathered hat. People are reacting in fear. He pulls out some crates from his bags and sets up a little shop in town.

Casting Comprehend Language reveals he doesn't speak any language.

He has some mundane looking trinkets and more interesting items:
- small ivory elephant
- old battered helmet
- 3 arrows set out on a red cloth, perfectly parallel. Heavy large arrowheads which look like they used to be shattered.
- A small pouch with flames on it. When inspected, it contains caltrops made out of claws similar to his own claws. The caltrops are hot
- A magical punching glove (a Cestus).
- A rusty sword and scabbard.
- A strange ring

I bought the arrows and and caltrops.

After we purchased our items, the merchant packed up and headed away quickly. Marlowe tailed him to where he disappeared around some boxes behind a warehouse. Mawlowe was questioned by a halfling merchant, Stephano Ricci, who was curious about why she was looking at the boxes. Stephano is interested in becoming a sheep merchant.

Mordecai doesn't know Stephano or the Mantis.

We cased the warehouse and spotted Stephano wearing the same hat as the Mantis. He left with a big backpack to Whitemoon Threads. Marlowe spotted him placing a pouch into a rucksack into a backpack.

Marlowe and I spent a full night drinking at a Whitemoon, waiting for Stephano to talk to Mordecai so that we could ask Mordecai about.

Harbeck said that the mantis wrote down the name Giovanni on the boat that delivered him here from one of the free cities. We tracked down the ship that Giovanni came on two days ago.

The next morning, we attempted to confront Stephano in Whitemoon. We were able to confront him, but it did piss off Mordecai.

On another day Kristif dueled Dorian and nearly killed him.


As we put the finishing touches on Maslin and I's stronghold, a member of the green moss society, Abrahma Locke with his wolf Akira, seek our help. They are wounded and look like they have been traveling for some time. He says Oxfrills and Begga ran into undead far to the north of the Smallwood out in the tundra. Oxfrills and Begga are alive but taken. They are in some sort of temple.

<hr>

## 15th of Marpenoth

Stronghold work complete. Kristif built a DADU for Elisha. I trained Marlowe in Nature.

More from Abrama: Their group was adventuring but ran into spirits and bloated, stronger zombies. Bog undead. They were suddenly attacked in great numbers. Some kinds of undead, such as a vampire or Necromancer, could coordinate undead like this. Abrahma gives us the best directions he can.

We depart for the area Abrahma describes: an old battlefield. It was a day and a half north-west of where they came out of the Smallwood. On the edge of a lake.

A cold bog. There is a lot of harsh wind. The forest protects Ice End from these cold winds from the north. There are few winds here, it is cold here. There are lots of birds here. Little weasels and Marmots. Signs of moose, caribou, wolves and lynx.

## 17th of Marpenoth

We eventually find arctic dead marshes. There are craters in the ground with still pools of water. It is devoid of wildlife. It reeks of bog.

Getting closer we see the mindflayer battle machines. This area shows signs of a battle instead of a massacre. In the craters are dead-half decomposing Eladrin. They died of unnatural causes and therefore weren't turned into magicite.

Marlowe performed some surgery on the mindflayer and Eladrin corpes. The mindflayer corpses are more gelatinous that expected. The brain is protected by muscle and cartilage. Other than the octopus head, they are mostly humanoid.

We start to hear disturbances in the water and corpses begin to emerge. I was cursed.

We saw another large crashed Nautiloid. I tried to climb down it but slipped and fell. So we sent Nicolo in instead. Marlowe started to lose telepathic link with Nicolo when he got too deep in the ship. Nicolo does find tracks or trails of animated dead.

We tracked the magical intensity to the northeast. The dead are generally moving northeast.

We made camp and set a watch.

## 18th of Marpenoth

Kristif on first watch, spotted a 4 bird flock flying towards. They resemble eagles but with rotting skin. Kristif and I shot down 3 of them and then the rest of us took to the sky and followed it. It headed in a straight line northeast and then we shot it down, and remade camp.

After a rest, we remounted the rays and then while flying, we overheard a fight. Two humans were fighting  a skeletal knight. One is a wealthy the other is a porter carrying a massive backback.

We meet Metellus the noble and Durante the porter and manservant. He recognizes Maslin and the Keswick family. He hails from the Free Cities. He adventures now by giving up his money.

He is finely attired and carries bejeweled weapons. He has a ruby broach and an ascot.

Metellus has been exploring the coast this way. He discovered that there was a place of power up the coastline. He is seeking his maid Fatelli, who fell into a good-sized cave below us and was taken. He would like us to assist him to find her, and in return will guide us to the place of power.  

He leads us to the entrance to a sinkhole. He won't join us, but says that Fatelli is concealed. Maslin and I descended into the cave. Fatelli was terrified to make noise, so Maslin cast fly on all of us so that we could float out silently.      

Fatelli describes a sentient bit of permafrost that would have ate us. She says the permafrost creature was perhaps using her for bait.

In a nearby clearing, Durante and Fatelli quickly set up a glamorous camp. He offers us snifters of delicious whiskey.

He tells us the undead are concentrated up the coast. He arrived a few weeks ago. Metellus converses with us for an hour out adventures. He has a ship off the coast now. He is interested in magicite to trade if it is viable.

Metellus leads us to the place of power he talked about. He produces a whistle and uses it to call a horse.

## 19th of Marpenoth

Metellus leads us to a cliff and then a beach walk.

In the distance we see a massive ivory skull. The size of a mythical giant's. The skull is nearly as large as the cliff. It appears like the erosion that created the cliff has also revealed this skull and a few arms.

<hr>

It's cold here.

To inspect the skull, I cast Pass Without Trace to sneak up on the skull. The Skull has tusks on the lower jaw. Metellus will not join us.

There is an entrance in the mouth of the skull that we are going to try to enter. Kristif climbed up the rope from a Rope Trick to be the first in the skeletal cave.

In the mouth is an alter with a lit brazier. There is stonework built into the skull. Stonework is unusual for this area.

After Marlowe fell while climbing the rope, undead emerged from the ocean to attack us. One of the zombies had an ornamental sword with the gems removed and otherwise valueless. This zombie is a little more fresh and has fewer barnacles on it.

On the dias of the alter, there is a script in very old common. "In veneration and memoriam of our fallen deity Sardush"

Kristif opens the door to the next room and hears screaming. We think the light is causing the screams. Kristif turned a lot of the undead.

Maslin sees paintings of a colossus emerging from the sea, the colossus getting hit with purple rays from sun of the second painting, and the skeleton of the colossus in it's current prone position, with and an ankh in the corner blasting it with rays.

We see sea related imagery on religious objects in the room.

I poured salt water from the alchemy jug into an empty fountain which had a righting feeling.

We got into another big fight with a big group of undead. I went down but got brought back by Kristif.

Beyond some metal doors is a natural forming pit. There is a whole above the ceiling. There is moss near the ankle deep water. Inside are unconscious Begga and Osfrils.

There is a collapsed wall the leads to a cavern that lead toward the ocean.

There is a tomb where coffins face in the direction of a painted face sculpted out of the wall. The face resembles the face of the colossus in the painting. Kristif detected a magic key in the mouth of the sculpture. This key opens a secret compartment in the alter in the mouth of the colossus. The little key is a jet (stone) ankh. In the compartment is a larger ankh but it has lost its vigor and polish. It seems the magic in is deaded and has been drained. Kristif says there should have been magical energy in it but it has been expended.

Begga is also drained. His eyes are sunken and dark. Osfrils is shaken and hurt and tries to care for Begga. She says they were exploring the area before the undead very suddenly arose and attacked them.

We told them Abrama and Akira were okay. Osfrils says she was a cobra when the zombies strangled her and captured her instead of killing her. They didn't see the boneclaw monster than attacked and knocked my out.

The larger ankh is a powerful artifact which has lost its power. Originally, it would have been able to channel enough power to kill a god.

<hr>

We made camp outside and let Osfrils and Begga recover. Metellus, Fatelli and Durante arrive. Maslin commented that the skeletons seemed to remember that they probably remembered their tactics from when they were alive. We concealed from him that we did take the artifact that he was looking for.

We invited him to Ice-end. Maslin schmoozed with Metellus over Brandy. Metellus tells of his younger days. He fought Manticores in the Sunset Coves beyond the Free Cities. He says he fought a growing Kraken. They seem embellished.

Maslin feels drawn in and being charmed. Maslin told Metellus about the ankh artifact we found but refused to give it up or trade for it.

As he begins to pack up, I noticed the sound of approaching wolves. I woke everyone up and we prepared to fight.

Metellus attacked us with the wolves! He seems resistant to necrotic damage and he has little fangs on his upper teeth. Maslin was still charmed by Metellus and didn't attack him directly. Radiant damage wasn't extra damaging.

From Metellus' camp we recovered a bag of holding with fancy furnishings for a camp.

They tried to escape but we were able to catch, kill and trap the soul of Durante. We asked it tactical questions.

1. Metellus has made his lair in a cave behind a waterfall, at the foot of mountains near the oceans.
2. He is weakened by the sunlight and the blessings of the gods. He can only be killed by being staked though the heart.
3. He can be a bat, and his fallen enemies can be brought back as thralls. He can control beasts of the night. He can move as a spider on it's web
4. He is a collector of wondrous and fantastic items, old and new.
5. We looked inside his wet cavern lair. There is a waterfall even on the sides leaving an island in the middle. There is a boat anchored near the rock. There is a tunnel leading out. There is a fancy dias with red and blue cloth. And a fancy coffin with gold and jewels. There are small tunnels leading out as well. We hear the sounds of the waterfall.
6. Metellus had nothing to do with the undead in the temple.

## 23rd of Marpenoth
We spent the last four days returning to Ice-end.

Returned to Ice-end without much difficulty. The Green Moss Society is happy to reunited. Abrahma restated the skeletons did seem to be organized.

Interviewing the town:
- Mordecai recognized the liquor bottles. The brandy is from Corvail but the others are from the Republic of Ostrovia. Ostovia is west of the Sunset coves.
- We asked Tenorio to ABC (Always Be Consecrating). Tenorio says there are many types of vampires but holy water is always helpful. We asked him to equip the fedorati with bottles of holy water. They are undead.
- Drusilla suggests the lair is in the mountain range to North of Ice-end.
- No one has heard of Sardush.
- We reported our adventure to Harbeck.
- Lady Cliffsend says the Ostrovia has many wealthy individuals. The Free Cities often fight with eachother. Ostrovian crossbowmen often make good solders and marines. She's heard of Strabo, thinks it may be one of the wealthy merchant families.


An envoy of the KaraJhinzkha arrived: A halfling and a human rider. The have a message from Yellow Arrow that wishes us well, and thanks us for the assistance. It is an update that the war with the Neiryet is going well but they are asking for assistance. She would like to meet with us in Subinity. We reply that we have our own issues to deal with. The KaraJhinzkha want to wrap us their campaign before the end of spring.

<hr>

Our plan is to scout for the vampire's lair. Also make a plan to go to Subinity.

A scholar passing through Ice-end, Bartholomew, has done a good amount of research about necromancy. He tells us there are many kinds of vampires. Their powers are dependent on their bloodline, lineage. Sometimes it is dependent on their emotions or feelings when they were killed. Reportedly, the most powerful are the True Vampires. They can turn people, but don't pass on their purity. It takes unholy amounts of blood sacrifice to create a True Vampire. You don't have to be a True Vampire to turn victims. Vampires need blood of the living. They usually choose intellect and nutrition of humanoids. They are truly unholy and shy away from the touch of the gods. Holy water can damage and slow their regeneration. Vampires need to return to their coffin. Vampires need to eat people. They do have the ability to charm. Were-bears can't convert someone by scratching them. Vampires do need to be invited to enter homes/buildings.

Fatelli was turned by Metellus. Killing Metellus will Fatelli.

Abrahma has recovered and is grateful to be reunited.

Each our of blessing water, 5gp of powdered silver can be consumed to create a vial of holy water.

I bought water arrows to have a 5 made holy.
2d6 radiant damage only to fiends and undead.
20/60 range.

Kristif spent the day making holy water.


## 24th of Marpenoth 1062
We are headed out to the northeast to find the lair. I tracked various animals and found aggressive bats. I spoke to some plants who reported some nearby plants are withered and in pain.  

We found the cave by the waterfall! There's a crude wooden dock by the entrance. No boat is there now, but the dock has been used relatively soon. There is a cliffside that goes up 40ft. The tunnels would be at the top of the cliff.

At the top of the cliff, we see small tunnels created by erosion but they are very small. We spend an hour filling in holes.

We found a ward at the mouth of the cave. We passed without trace and sneaked into the tunnel while walking on the water.

In side is the island as described in the soul trap. Two elementals are guarding the coffin and rug. A wind elemental and an armored water elemental. We killed them.

Maslin found a false bottom in a pool in the cave. It was a stone drawer. I pryed it open and inside were several gems, an ornate gold dagger. Also a few broken vials dribbling liquids outside which I was able to catch. The ornate has the same label as the bottle of red wine. The Strabo house. The dagger might be ritualistic or magical.

Kristif finds a fake stalactite containing a bag containing scrolls and books. Some scrolls are magical but others are letters or paperwork. One of the books is a ledger. Another book is stamped with the Strabo house and is locked.

The ledger has an inventory and it seems like there are more things here in the cave.

I shot Metellus with a holy water arrow and then a real arrow and killed him. When he died, the others disappeared too

## 26th Marpenoth 1062

I spotted half dozen flying creatures, mounted storm rays. Between them is a large burning four-winged humanoid. We tried to make it to our the Wildwood.

The burning man is carrying a glaive and a bow in each hand. "Feel the embrace of fire and embrace" but we made it to our strongholds. The burning angel thing is not Firefist, but considers Firefist saintly.

Blackblade reported that the kenku were under attack as well. They were able to repel the attack with the help of the wolves in the stronghold, Wildwood. But he saw a another detachment heading towards ice end.

Arriving to town, we spotted Nieryet attacking. Riders and infantry accompanied by another fire angel are attempting to force their way into Marlowes house. We won the fight and killed all the raiders but Calvin was nearly killed by a fireball.

Margareta said that they weren't going to kill her because "Father" wouldn't have liked that. She says that Marlowe was to die. She says Father is trying to extract vengeance from Marlowe. Marlowe says Calvin would be willing to lay down his life for her. Marlowe expressed interest in leveling the city of Tumen Ord. Margareta recommends gaining vengeance over time.
