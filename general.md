 Deep crisp blue water  
 Thin forestation: pines and   
 Some nearby permafrost and marshes

## Corvail
 South of Balthier.  
 One of the stronger free cities.    
 Ruled by an oligarchic republic.
 Has a small but well trained army.  

## Ice end
 Dirt roads  
 Houses are all made of wood. Similar wood from Lothal.  
 Dirty but the roads are dry.  
 Population in the hundreds  
 Days are long right now.  
 Can be buggy.  
 Claimed a place near the forest near Drusilla and a cliff.

### Tenorio's chapel in ice-end
  Dedicated to Eristal
  Tenorio's chapel is small gazebo mostly outdoors.  
  Built around a hearth-fire  

## Rookrustle
Rookrustle is a kenku village three-ish days north-west of ice-end.  
Rookrustle is a small town ringing a massive black tunnel. The Pit is exceptionally
deep. The Kenku have assembled some kind of on one side of the Pit.
The building are old and well made. This village seems old and rooted.
The population appears to be smaller in population than ice-end.
There are no other non-kenku here but ourselves. The kenku are led by Storymaster.
The buildings are kenku centric and house nests.
The fore-minds, our creators charged us with defending the pit. Only storymaster
in the most dire need may enter the sanctum. The fore-mind is the creator of these
kenku.



### The Lonely Butterfly (Poem)
```
The Lonely Butterfly  
Then I heard a voice:  
"Go back to the garden and bury  
The happy butterfly, and you."  
I stood looking, because I had never been to the garden, and stopped  
her, for I must bring her back to the garden in the evening.
```

### Scepter of Aquatic Influence
 Found near the gathering of Crowned Crab. The Scepter of Aquatic Influence gives the wielder a +2 bonus to Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks to influence animals of an aquatic origin. If the creature can communicate verbally with the creature, it grants Advantage on Charisma checks directed towards non-hostile acquatic creatures. It is not known who originally constructed this particular scepter, but the barnacles and sea rot evident in the scepter indicates it may have been lost at sea for a time. It is colored blue and gold.

### The section from the orcish journal in the ruined tower
```[...] dreams at night. A horrible face, yelling and screaming through a mouth full of blood. My blood. I feel weaker and [illegible] every night. Korlash says I look paler every day.

	Tomorrow I will ask [illegible] for [illegible] to leave, as soon as possible. I don’t think I can last another [The rest of the page is blank]
