Derwood was raised in a large wood-elf forest retreat of Lenecasatha (Seawatch). Lenecasatha has two notable neighbors, a dark-goblin breeding-pit "Stekug Olzul"(goblin for Leap Legend) and high-elven commune "Imìrafici" (Airpraised).
In his formative-forties, he met the high-elf Rikki Cricket, (in elvish Icica Themita, or lightning bug) and merely a decade later, the two made what they assumed was an act of rebellion and ran away from their homes. However, in elf-culture, this not too uncommon and his parents were a little too happy to have him out of the tree and making a life for himself.
Eventually Rikki became pregnant and the two settled in Lothal where they raised a daughter "Lònethu" and son "Wetholi". Rikki taught rudimentary magic to the children of merchants and earls while Derwood worked on developing his horticulture skills.
City life lost its romance, and after Lònethu and Wetholi committed their own acts of insurrection, Derwood and Rikki we happy to sign up to move to a open continent.
